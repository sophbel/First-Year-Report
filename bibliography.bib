  abstract = {Background: Cholera has been endemic in Ghana since its detection in 1970. It has been shown that long-term survival of the bacteria may be attained in aquatic environments. Consequently, cholera outbreaks may be triggered predominantly in densely populated urban areas. We investigated clinical and environmental isolates of Vibrio cholerae O1 in Accra to determine their virulence genes, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and environmental factors maintaining their persistence in the environment. Methods: Water samples from various sources were analyzed for the presence of V. cholerae O1 using culture methods. Forty clinical isolates from a previous cholera outbreak were included in the study for comparison. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the bacteria were determined by disc diffusion. Virulence genes were identified by analyzing genes for ctx, tcpA (tcpAEl Tor tcpACl), zot, ompW, rbfO1 and attRS using PCR. Physicochemical characteristics of water were investigated using standard methods. One-way ANOVA and student t - test were employed to analyze the relationship between physicochemical factors and the occurrence of V. cholerae O1. Results: Eleven V. cholerae O1 strains were successfully isolated from streams, storage tanks and wells during the study period. All isolates were resistant to one or more of the eight antibiotics used. Multidrug resistance was observed in over 97\% of the isolates. All isolates had genes for at least one virulence factor. Vibrio cholerae toxin gene was detected in 82.4\% of the isolates. Approximately 81.8\% of the isolates were positive for tcpAEl Tor gene, but also harbored the tcpAcl gene. Isolates were grouped into thirteen genotypes based on the genes analyzed. High temperature, salinity, total dissolved solids and conductivity was found to significantly correlate positively with isolation of V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae serotype Ogawa biotype El tor is the main biotype circulating in Ghana with the emergence of a hybrid strain. Conclusions: Multidrug resistant V. cholerae O1 with different genotypes and pathogenicity are present in water sources and co-exist with non O1/O139 in the study area.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Biomarkers that can predict the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients with psoriasis would be useful in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess whether CXCL10 could be a predictive biomarker of PsA prior to its onset. METHODS Psoriasis patients without arthritis were followed up prospectively and assessed annually for development of PsA by a rheumatologist. Patients in whom PsA developed were designated as converters, while those in whom PsA did not develop were termed nonconverters. Baseline serum concentrations of CXCL10 were measured by Luminex assay in 46 converters and 45 nonconverters. RESULTS The level of CXCL10 was significantly higher in converters (median 493 pg/ml [interquartile range (IQR) 356-984]) than in nonconverters (median 371 pg/ml [IQR 263-578]; P = 0.005). In contrast, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were not significantly different between converters and nonconverters at baseline. CXCL10 was associated with conversion status after adjustment for age, sex, duration of psoriasis, and duration of follow-up (odds ratio 1.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.1-1.5, P = 0.004). In a subset of converters, the CXCL10 level was significantly higher at baseline (median 927.4 pg/ml [IQR 547.6-1,243]) than after PsA diagnosis (491.5 pg/ml [IQR 323.2-607]; P \textbackslash textless 0.0001), while CRP levels were lower at baseline (26.6 μg/ml [IQR 16.37-62.75]) than after PsA diagnosis (36.1 μg/ml [IQR 14.74-101.7]; P = 0.003). CXCL10 gene expression was increased 17.3-fold in synovial fluid (SF) compared with blood from PsA patients (P = 0.01) and 44.3-fold in the SF of PsA patients compared with the SF of patients with gout (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION CXCL10 may be involved in PsA pathogenesis and is a candidate predictive biomarker for PsA in patients with psoriasis.},

  abstract = {Background Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in low income countries where pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are still underused. In countries where PCVs have been introduced, much of their efficacy has resulted from their impact on nasopharyngeal carriage in vaccinated children. Understanding the epidemiology of carriage for S. pneumoniae and other common respiratory bacteria in developing countries is crucial for implementing appropriate vaccination strategies and evaluating their impact. Methods and Findings We have systematically reviewed published studies reporting nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria meningitidis in children and adults in low and lower-middle income countries. Studies reporting pneumococcal carriage for healthy children {$<$}5 years of age were selected for a meta-analysis. The prevalences of carriage for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis were generally higher in low income than in lower-middle income countries and were higher in young children than in adults. The prevalence of S. aureus was high in neonates. Meta-analysis of data from young children before the introduction of PCVs showed a pooled prevalence estimate of 64.8\% (95\% confidence interval, 49.8\%–76.1\%) in low income countries and 47.8\% (95\% confidence interval, 44.7\%–50.8\%) in lower-middle income countries. The most frequent serotypes were 6A, 6B, 19A, 19F, and 23F. Conclusions In low and lower-middle income countries, pneumococcal carriage is frequent, especially in children, and the spectrum of serotypes is wide. However, because data are limited, additional studies are needed to adequately assess the impact of PCV introduction on carriage of respiratory bacteria in these countries.},

  abstract = {We propose a two-step procedure for estimating multiple migration rates in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework, accounting for global nuisance parameters. The approach is not limited to migration, but generally of interest for inference problems with multiple parameters and a modular structure (e.g. independent sets of demes or loci). We condition on a known, but complex demographic model of a spatially subdivided population, motivated by the reintroduction of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) into Switzerland. In the first step, the global parameters ancestral mutation rate and male mating skew have been estimated for the whole population in Aeschbacher et al. (Genetics 2012; 192: 1027). In the second step, we estimate in this study the migration rates independently for clusters of demes putatively connected by migration. For large clusters (many migration rates), ABC faces the problem of too many summary statistics. We therefore assess by simulation if estimation per pair of demes is a valid alternative. We find that the trade-off between reduced dimensionality for the pairwise estimation on the one hand and lower accuracy due to the assumption of pairwise independence on the other depends on the number of migration rates to be inferred: the accuracy of the pairwise approach increases with the number of parameters, relative to the joint estimation approach. To distinguish between low and zero migration, we perform ABC-type model comparison between a model with migration and one without. Applying the approach to microsatellite data from Alpine ibex, we find no evidence for substantial gene flow via migration, except for one pair of demes in one direction.},

  abstract = {The choice of summary statistics is a crucial step in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Since statistics are often not sufficient, this choice involves a trade-off between loss of information and reduction of dimensionality. The latter may increase the efficiency of ABC. Here, we propose an approach for choosing summary statistics based on boosting, a technique from the machine-learning literature. We consider different types of boosting and compare them to partial least-squares regression as an alternative. To mitigate the lack of sufficiency, we also propose an approach for choosing summary statistics locally, in the putative neighborhood of the true parameter value. We study a demographic model motivated by the reintroduction of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) into the Swiss Alps. The parameters of interest are the mean and standard deviation across microsatellites of the scaled ancestral mutation rate (θanc = 4Neu) and the proportion of males obtaining access to matings per breeding season (ω). By simulation, we assess the properties of the posterior distribution obtained with the various methods. According to our criteria, ABC with summary statistics chosen locally via boosting with the L2-loss performs best. Applying that method to the ibex data, we estimate θ\^anc≈1.288 and find that most of the variation across loci of the ancestral mutation rate u is between 7.7 × 10−4 and 3.5 × 10−3 per locus per generation. The proportion of males with access to matings is estimated as ω\^≈0.21, which is in good agreement with recent independent estimates.},

Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches.

The colonial demarcation of African borders accounts for their porous nature initially, as borderland populations challenged the unjust scission of their cultural, economic, geographical and geopolitical spaces. However, new forms of porosity also evolved over time, masterminded by new actors. Drawing on the Ghana–Togo border case, and through interviews, observation and documentary analysis, this article argues that border control agencies are partly responsible for the current border porosity and attendant security problems as their jurisdiction has shifted to a multi-layered border parasitism. The article is not, however, an attack on border law enforcement agencies; rather it attempts to explore their roles in shielding the region, already exposed to terrorism and piracy, from further security threats.},

  abstract = {The ongoing coevolutionary struggle between hosts and pathogens, with hosts evolving to escape pathogen infection and pathogens evolving to escape host defences, can generate an ‘arms race’, i.e., the occurrence of recurrent selective sweeps that each favours a novel resistance or virulence allele that goes to fixation. Host–pathogen coevolution can alternatively lead to a ‘trench warfare’, i.e., balancing selection, maintaining certain alleles at loci involved in host–pathogen recognition over long time scales. Recently, technological and methodological progress has enabled detection of footprints of selection directly on genes, which can provide useful insights into the processes of coevolution. This knowledge can also have practical applications, for instance development of vaccines or drugs. Here we review the methods for detecting genes under positive selection using divergence data (i.e., the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, dN/dS). We also review methods for detecting selection using polymorphisms, such as methods based on FST measures, frequency spectrum, linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure. In the second part, we review examples where targets of selection have been identified in pathogens using these tests. Genes under positive selection in pathogens have mostly been sought among viruses, bacteria and protists, because of their paramount importance for human health. Another focus is on fungal pathogens owing to their agronomic importance. We finally discuss promising directions in pathogen studies, such as detecting selection in non-coding regions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has posed additional challenges for global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, as limited treatment options are available and treatment outcomes are often sub-optimal. This study determined treatment outcomes among a cohort of MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients in Hunan Province, China, and identified factors associated with poor treatment outcomes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study using data obtained from medical records of TB patients in Hunan Chest Hospital, and from the internet-based TB management information system managed by the Tuberculosis Control Institute of Hunan Province, for the period 2011 to 2014. Treatment outcomes were assessed for patients diagnosed with MDR-TB (TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) and XDR-TB (MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least 1 second-line injectable drug). Cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate time to events (i.e. poor treatment outcomes, loss to follow-up, and unfavourable treatment outcomes); and a competing-risks survival regression model was used to identify predictors of treatment outcomes. RESULT Of 481 bacteriologically-confirmed patients, with a mean age of 40~years (standard deviation SD~±~13~years), 10 (2\%) had XDR-TB and the remainder (471; 98\%) had MDR-TB. For the entire cohort, treatment success was 57\% (n~=~275); 58\% (n~=~272) for MDR-TB and 30\% (n~=~3) for XDR-TB. Overall, 27\% were lost to follow-up (n~=~130), 27\% (n~=~126) for MDR-TB and 40\% (n~=~4) for XDR-TB; and 16\% had a poor treatment outcome (n~=~76), 15\% for MDR-TB and 30\% (n~=~3) for XDR-TB. Of the 10 XDR-TB patients, 3 (30\%) completed treatment, 3 (30\%) died and 4 (40\%) were lost to follow-up. Of the 471 MDR-TB patients, 258 (57\%) were cured, 16 (3\%) completed treatment, 13 (3\%) died, 60 (13\%) experienced treatment failure, and 126 (27\%) were lost to follow-up. Resistance to ofloxacin was an independent predictor of poor (AHR~=~3.1; 95\%CI~=~1.5, 6.3), and unfavourable (AHR~=~1.7; 95\%CI~=~1.07, 2.9) treatment outcomes. Patients who started treatment during 2011-2012 (AHR~=~2.8; 95\% CI~=~1.5, 5.3) and 2013 (AHR~=~2.1; 95\% CI~=~1.2, 3.9) had poorer treatment outcomes compared to patients who started treatment during 2014. CONCLUSION Patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB had low rates of treatment success in Hunan Province, especially among patients who started treatment during 2011 to 2013, with evidence of improved treatment outcomes in 2014. Resistance to ofloxacin was an independent predictor of poor treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate a possible systemic effect of joint inflammation in contrast to skin disease only, by measuring IL-6 and IL-2sRalpha. METHODS Two hundred and nineteen patients (111 male / 108 female, age 50.4+/-14.5 yrs (mean+/-SD)) with psoriasis were clinically and laboratory examined. 134 patients had inflammatory joint manifestations defined as peripheral arthritis and/or axial disease, of whom 37 had measurable inflammation, defined as ESR \textbackslash textgreater25 mm/h and/or CRP \textbackslash textgreater15 mg/L. RESULTS Interleukin-6 was significantly higher in patients with joint disease and measurable inflammation ((median, Q1-Q3) 4.07, 0.92-14.60), and in patients without measured inflammation (1.22, 0.70-3.46), compared to patients with skin disease only (0.70, 0.70-1.73, p\textbackslash textless0.001 and p=0.002 respectively). The difference between the two groups of patients with inflammatory joint manifestations was significant (p=0.001). The levels of IL-6 correlated with the actual number of joints affected with arthritis (p\textbackslash textless0.001; rs=0.248), ESR (p\textbackslash textless0.001; rs=0.459), CRP (p\textbackslash textless0.001; rs=0.314) and IL-2sRalpha (p=0.002; rs=0.210). The levels of IL-2sRalpha. did not differ between the 3 groups. CONCLUSION In this study, IL-6 was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory joint disease with or without routine measurable inflammatory activity compared with patients having psoriasis of the skin. We found that patients with psoriasis and joint inflammation may have systemic effects that could be captured by serum measurements of IL-6. Soluble IL-2Ralpha was not a marker of inflammation in this study.},

  abstract = {The ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex BAF (=\,mammalian SWI/SNF complex) is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and differentiation. In the course of evolution from yeast to mammals, the BAF complex evolved an immense complexity with a high number of subunits encoded by gene families. In this way, tissue-specific BAF function and regulation of development begin with the combinatorial assembly of distinct BAF complexes such as esBAF, npBAF and nBAF. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing reveals the tremendous role BAF complex mutations have in both neurodevelopmental disorders and human malignancies. Therefore, gaining a more elaborate insight into how BAF complex assembly influences its function and which role distinct subunits play, will hopefully give rise to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and ultimately to new treatments for many human diseases.},

Objectives: To assess the prevalence and incidence of PsA in patients with psoriasis. Methods: Two authors independently searched 3 databases for studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of PsA in patients with psoriasis. A proportion meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled proportion estimates of PsA in patients with psoriasis. Results: A total of 266 studies examining 976,408 patients with psoriasis were included. Overall, the pooled proportion (95\% confidence interval [CI]) of PsA among patients with psoriasis was 19.7\% (95\% CI, 18.5\%-20.9\%). In children and adolescents (\textbackslash textless18 years of age), the pooled prevalence was 3.3\% (95\% CI, 2.1\%-4.9\%). The PsA prevalence was 22.7\% (95\% CI, 20.6\%-25.0\%) in European patients with psoriasis, 21.5\% (95\% CI, 15.4\%-28.2\%) in South American patients with psoriasis, 19.5\% (95\% CI, 17.1\%-22.1\%) in North American patients with psoriasis, 15.5\% (95\% CI, 0.009\%-51.5\%) in African patients with psoriasis, and 14.0\% (95\% CI, 95\% CI, 11.7\%-16.3\%) in Asian patients with psoriasis. The prevalence of PsA was 23.8\% (95\% CI, 20.1\%-27.6\%) in studies in which the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis were applied. The incidence of PsA among patients with psoriasis ranged from 0.27 to 2.7 per 100 person-years. Limitations: Between-study heterogeneity may have affected the estimates. Conclusions: We found that 1 in 4 patients with psoriasis have PsA. With the growing recognition of the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis, more homogenous and comparable prevalence estimates are expected to be reported.},

  abstract = {Changes in Dengue virus (DENV) disease patterns in the Americas over recent decades have been attributed, at least in part, to repeated introduction of DENV strains from other regions, resulting in a shift from hypoendemicity to hyperendemicity. Using newly sequenced DENV-1 and DENV-3 envelope (E) gene isolates from 11 Caribbean countries, along with sequences available on GenBank, we sought to document the population genetic and spatiotemporal transmission histories of the four main invading DENV genotypes within the Americas and investigate factors that influence the rate and intensity of DENV transmission. For all genotypes, there was an initial invasion phase characterized by rapid increases in genetic diversity, which coincided with the first confirmed cases of each genotype in the region. Rapid geographic dispersal occurred upon each genotype's introduction, after which individual lineages were locally maintained, and gene flow was primarily observed among neighboring and nearby countries. There were, however, centers of viral diversity (Barbados, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil) that were repeatedly involved in gene flow with more distant locations. For DENV-1 and DENV-2, we found that a “distance-informed” model, which posits that the intensity of virus movement between locations is inversely proportional to the distance between them, provided a better fit than a model assuming equal rates of movement between all pairs of countries. However, for DENV-3 and DENV-4, the more stochastic “equal rates” model was preferred.},

We studied pneumococcal carriage dynamics in healthy adults using high-sensitivity approaches.Eighty-seven adults (25–50 years old) were followed for 6 months in Portugal.

Carriage was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (targeting lytA and piaB) and culture. Positive samples were serotyped.Approximately 20\% of the adults were intermittent carriers; 10\% were persistent carriers (\&gt;4 months). Pneumococcal acquisition and clearance rates were 16.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 11.2–24.2) and 95.9 (95\% CI, 62.3–145.0) cases/1000 person-weeks, respectively. Living with children increased pneumococcal acquisition (hazard ratio, 9.7 [95\% CI, 2.6–20.5]; P\hspace{0.25em}\&lt;\hspace{0.25em}.001). Median duration of carriage was 7 weeks and did not depend on regular contact with children.The pneumococcal carrier state in healthy adults is more dynamic than generally assumed: Acquisition is frequent and duration of carriage is often long. This suggests that some adults may act as reservoirs of pneumococci and hence, depending on the social structure of a community, the magnitude of herd effects potentially attainable through children vaccination may vary. These findings are important when designing strategies to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults.},

  abstract = {The genus Streptococcus contains 104 recognized species, many of which are associated with human or animal hosts. A globally prevalent human pathogen in this group is Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus). While being a common resident of the upper respiratory tract, it is also a major cause of otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent findings demonstrate the importance of recombination and selection in driving the population dynamics and evolution of different pneumococcal lineages, allowing them to successfully evade the impacts of selective pressures such as vaccination and antibiotic treatment. We highlight the ability of pneumococci to respond to these pressures through processes including serotype replacement, capsular switching and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes. The challenge in controlling this pathogen also lies in the exceptional genetic and phenotypic variation among different pneumococcal lineages, particularly in terms of their pathogenicity and resistance to current therapeutic strategies. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which target only a small subset of the more than 90 pneumococcal serotypes, provides us with a unique opportunity to elucidate how the processes of selection and recombination interact to generate a remarkable level of plasticity and heterogeneity in the pneumococcal genome. These processes also play an important role in the emergence and spread of multi-resistant strains, which continues to pose a challenge in disease control and/or eradication. The application of population of genomic approaches at different spatial and temporal scales will help improve strategies to control this global pathogen, and potentially other pathogenic streptococci.},

OBJECTIVE To establish a molecular line-probe assay (GenoType MTBDRplus) for detecting DR-TB in Ghana. METHOD We first screened 113 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates using the indirect proportion method and MTBDRplus. The rpoB and katG genes and the promoter regions of oxyR-ahpC and inhA were sequenced to identify mutations in isolates found to be resistant on phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and/or MTBDRplus. We then analysed an additional 412 isolates using only MTBDRplus. RESULTS Respectively 43 (8.2\%) and 8 (1.5\%) isolates were resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), while 8 (1.5\%) were multidrug-resistant. In resistant isolates, mutations in codon 450 of rpoB and codon 315 of katG, conferring resistance to respectively RMP and INH, dominated. We found two RMP-resistant isolates with a S450L substitution, each harbouring an additional mutation at S388L and Q409R. Using phenotypic testing as gold standard, the MTBDRplus assay showed a sensitivity and specificity in the detection of RMP and INH resistance and multidrug resistance of respectively 100\% and 100\%, 83.3\% and 100\%, and 100\% and 100\%. CONCLUSION The high sensitivity of MTBDRplus makes it a valuable addition to the conventional TB diagnostic algorithm in Ghana.},

The nucleic acid proximity-based methods proximity ligation and proximity extension assays have, with their dual reporters, shown potential to relieve the shortcomings of antibodies and their inherent cross-reactivity in multiplex protein quantification applications. The aim of the present study was to develop a robust 96-plex immunoassay based on the proximity extension assay (PEA) for improved high throughput detection of protein biomarkers. This was enabled by: (1) a modified design leading to a reduced number of pipetting steps compared to the existing PEA protocol, as well as improved intra-assay precision; (2) a new enzymatic system that uses a hyper-thermostabile enzyme, Pwo, for uniting the two probes allowing for room temperature addition of all reagents and improved the sensitivity; (3) introduction of an inter-plate control and a new normalization procedure leading to improved inter-assay precision (reproducibility). The multiplex proximity extension assay was found to perform well in complex samples, such as serum and plasma, and also in xenografted mice and resuspended dried blood spots, consuming only 1 µL sample per test. All-in-all, the development of the current multiplex technique is a step toward robust high throughput protein marker discovery and research.},

  abstract = {Wild birds have been implicated in the emergence of human and livestock influenza. The successful prediction of viral spread and disease emergence, as well as formulation of preparedness plans have been hampered by a critical lack of knowledge of viral movements between different host populations. The patterns of viral spread and subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses therefore remain unpredictable. Here we analyze genomic data, including 287 newly sequenced avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. We use a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure and patterns of genetic reassortment. Our results reveal that despite the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay this host population does not appear to significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity sampled in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. While AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, our large-scale analysis showed that the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways with migration between populations throughout North America. Analysis of long-term surveillance data provides vital insights to develop appropriately informed predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection., Despite continuous virological surveillance (1976–2009) in wild waterfowl (Anseriformes) and shorebirds (Charadriiformes), the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza A virus (AIV) in these hosts is poorly understood. Comparative genomic analysis of AIV data revealed that the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay is a reservoir of AIV that is phylogenetically distinct from AIV sampled from most North American Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the remaining AIV diversity sampled across North America. While AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, our large-scale analysis showed that this population genetic structure was transient and the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways. These results suggest an introduced virus lineage may initially be restricted to one flyway, but migration to a major congregation site such as Alberta could occur followed by subsequent spread across flyways. These generalized predictions for virus movement will be critical to assess the associated risk for widespread diffusion and inform surveillance for pandemic preparedness.},

We conducted a systematic review of data published since 1951 to assess the effect of primary IPT on the risk for isoniazid-resistant TB. Different definitions of isoniazid resistance were used, which affected summary effect estimates; we report the most consistent results. When all 13 studies (N = 18,095 persons in isoniazid groups and N = 17,985 persons in control groups) were combined, the summary relative risk for resistance was 1.45 (95\% confidence interval 0.85-2.47). Results were similar when studies of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons were considered separately. Analyses were limited by small numbers and incomplete testing of isolates, but findings do not exclude an increased risk for isoniazid-resistant TB after IPT. The diagnosis of active TB should be excluded before IPT. Continued surveillance for isoniazid resistance is essential.},

  abstract = {Objectives Burden of pneumococcal disease depends on the prevalence and invasive disease potential of serotypes. We aimed to estimate the invasive disease potential of serotypes in children under 5 years of age by combining data from different settings with routine immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). Methods We conducted a systematic review, supplemented by unpublished data, to identify data on the frequency of pneumococcal serotypes in carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We estimated the invasive disease potential of serotypes as the ratio of IPD in relation to carriage (odds ratio and 95\%CI) compared with 19A (reference serotype) by meta-analysis. We report results based on a random effects model for children aged 0–23, 24–29, and 0–59 months and by invasive clinical syndromes. Results In comparison with 19A, serotypes 1, 7F, and 12F had a significantly higher invasive disease potential in children aged 0–23 and 0–59 months for all IPD and clinical syndromes (OR {$>$} 5). Several non-vaccine types (NVTs) (6C, 15A, 15BC, 16F, 23B, in these two age groups) had a lower invasive disease potential than 19A (OR 0.1–0.3). NVTs 8, 12F, 24F, and 33F were at the upper end of the invasiveness spectrum. Conclusions There is substantial variation among pneumococcal serotypes in their potential to cause IPD and disease presentation, which is influenced by age and time after PCV introduction. Surveillance of IPD and carriage is critical to understand the expected effectiveness of current PCVs (in the longer term) and guide the development of future vaccines.},

It has been hypothesized that the genus Mycobacterium originated more than 150 million years ago. In the Middle Ages, scrofula, a disease affecting cervical lymph nodes, was described as a new clinical form of TB. The illness was known in England and France as "king's evil", and it was widely believed that persons affected could heal after a royal touch. In 1720, for the first time, the infectious origin of TB was conjectured by the English physician Benjamin Marten, while the first successful remedy against TB was the introduction of the sanatorium cure. The famous scientist Robert Koch was able to isolate the tubercle bacillus and presented this extraordinary result to the society of Physiology in Berlin on 24 March 1882. In the decades following this discovery, the Pirquet and Mantoux tuberculin skin tests, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin BCG vaccine, Selman Waksman streptomycin and other anti-tuberculous drugs were developed.},

Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavivirus disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of Fcγ receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible mice resulted in increased morbidity-including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal cord and testes-and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights the need to exert great caution when designing flavivirus vaccines.},

  abstract = {Bordetella pertussis causes pertussis, a respiratory disease that is most severe for infants. Vaccination was introduced in the 1950s, and in recent years, a resurgence of disease was observed worldwide, with significant mortality in infants. Possible causes for this include the switch from whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) to less effective acellular vaccines (ACVs), waning immunity, and pathogen adaptation. Pathogen adaptation is suggested by antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains and by the emergence of strains with increased pertussis toxin production. We applied comparative genomics to a worldwide collection of 343 B. pertussis strains isolated between 1920 and 2010. The global phylogeny showed two deep branches; the largest of these contained 98\% of all strains, and its expansion correlated temporally with the first descriptions of pertussis outbreaks in Europe in the 16th century. We found little evidence of recent geographical clustering of the strains within this lineage, suggesting rapid strain flow between countries. We observed that changes in genes encoding proteins implicated in protective immunity that are included in ACVs occurred after the introduction of WCVs but before the switch to ACVs. Furthermore, our analyses consistently suggested that virulence-associated genes and genes coding for surface-exposed proteins were involved in adaptation. However, many of the putative adaptive loci identified have a physiological role, and further studies of these loci may reveal less obvious ways in which B. pertussis and the host interact. This work provides insight into ways in which pathogens may adapt to vaccination and suggests ways to improve pertussis vaccines. IMPORTANCE Whooping cough is mainly caused by Bordetella pertussis, and current vaccines are targeted against this organism. Recently, there have been increasing outbreaks of whooping cough, even where vaccine coverage is high. Analysis of the genomes of 343 B. pertussis isolates from around the world over the last 100 years suggests that the organism has emerged within the last 500 years, consistent with historical records. We show that global transmission of new strains is very rapid and that the worldwide population of B. pertussis is evolving in response to vaccine introduction, potentially enabling vaccine escape.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Most organisms are more closely related to nearby than distant members of their species, creating spatial autocorrelations in genetic data. This allows us to predict the location of origin of a genetic sample by comparing it to a set of samples of known geographic origin. Here we describe a deep learning method, which we call             Locator             , to accomplish this task faster and more accurately than existing approaches. In simulations,             Locator             infers sample location to within 4.1 generations of dispersal and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than a recent model-based approach. We leverage             Locator             ’s computational efficiency to predict locations separately in windows across the genome, which allows us to both quantify uncertainty and describe the mosaic ancestry and patterns of geographic mixing that characterize many populations.

For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

Expression of a polysaccharide capsule is essential for survival in the blood, and thus for virulence, but also is a target for host antibodies and the basis for effective vaccines. Encapsulated species typically exhibit antigenic variation and express one of a number of immunochemically distinct capsular polysaccharides that define serotypes. We provide the sequences of the capsular biosynthetic genes of all 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and relate these to the known polysaccharide structures and patterns of immunological reactivity of typing sera, thereby providing the most complete understanding of the genetics and origins of bacterial polysaccharide diversity, laying the foundations for molecular serotyping. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a complete repertoire of capsular biosynthetic genes has been available, enabling a holistic analysis of a bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis system. Remarkably, the total size of alternative coding DNA at this one locus exceeds 1.8 Mbp, almost equivalent to the entire S. pneumoniae chromosomal complement.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics coupled to liquid chromatography has matured into an automatized, high-throughput technology, producing data on the scale of multiple gigabytes per instrument per day. Consequently, an automated quality control (QC) and quality analysis (QA) capable of detecting measurement bias, verifying consistency, and avoiding propagation of error is paramount for instrument operators and scientists in charge of downstream analysis. We have developed an R-based QC pipeline called Proteomics Quality Control (PTXQC) for bottom-up LC−MS data generated by the MaxQuant 1 software pipeline. PTXQC creates a QC report containing a comprehensive and powerful set of QC metrics, augmented with automated scoring functions. The automated scores are collated to create an overview heatmap at the beginning of the report, giving valuable guidance also to nonspecialists. Our software supports a wide range of experimental designs, including stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), tandem mass tags (TMT), and label-free data. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to score MaxQuant's Match-between-runs (MBR) functionality by which peptide identifications can be transferred across Raw files based on accurate retention time and m/z. Last but not least, PTXQC is easy to install and use and represents the first QC software capable of processing MaxQuant result tables. PTXQC is freely available at https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC.},

In lupus, detection of endogenous chromatin complexes by the innate sensing machinery is the suspected driver for the IFN, but the actual mechanisms remain unknown in all of these diseases. We investigated in two randomized clinical trials the effects on RA patients of baminercept, a lymphotoxin-beta receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein that blocks the lymphotoxin-αβ/LIGHT axis. Administration of baminercept led to a reduced RNA IFN signature in the blood of patients with elevated baseline signatures. Both RA and SLE patients with a high IFN signature were lymphopenic and lymphocyte counts increased following baminercept treatment of RA patients. These data demonstrate a coupling between the lymphotoxin-LIGHT system and IFN production in rheumatoid arthritis. IFN induced retention of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues is a likely component of the lymphopenia observed in many autoimmune diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00664716.},

Evidence-based guidelines for tuberculosis screening are available, but literature assessing their implementation and the quality of clinical practice is scarce. OBJECTIVES To assess tuberculosis screening practices and the effectiveness of audit and performance feedback to improve quality of tuberculosis screening at HIV care clinics in Ghana. DESIGN Healthcare providers at 10 large HIV care clinics prospectively registered patient consultations during May and October 2014, before and after a performance feedback intervention in August 2014. The outcomes of interest were overall tuberculosis suspicion rate during consultations and provider adherence to the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care and the World Health Organizations' guidelines for symptom-based tuberculosis screening among PLHIV. RESULTS Twenty-one healthcare providers registered a total of 2,666 consultations; 1,368 consultations before and 1,298 consultations after the feedback intervention. Tuberculosis suspicion rate during consultation increased from 12.6 to 20.9\% after feedback (odds ratio, OR 1.83; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-3.09). Before feedback, sputum smear microscopy was requested for 58.7\% of patients with suspected tuberculosis, for 47.2\% of patients with cough ≥2 weeks, and for 27.5\% of patients with a positive World Health Organization (WHO) symptom screen (any of current cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats). After feedback, patients with a positive WHO symptom screen were more likely to be suspected of tuberculosis (OR 2.21; 95\% CI: 1.19-4.09) and referred for microscopy (OR 2.71; 95\% CI: 1.25-5.86). CONCLUSIONS A simple prospective audit tool identified flaws in clinical practices for tuberculosis screening of PLHIV. There was no systematic identification of people with suspected active tuberculosis. We found low initial tuberculosis suspicion rate compounded by low referral rates of relevant patients for sputum smear microscopy. Adherence to recommended standards and guidelines for tuberculosis screening improved after performance feedback.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}\emph{Streptococcus pneumoniae} is an important pathogen causing invasive diseases such as sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. The burden of disease is highest in the youngest and oldest sections of the population in both more and less developed countries. The treatment of pneumococcal infections is complicated by the worldwide emergence in pneumococci of resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics. Pneumococcal disease is preceded by asymptomatic colonisation, which is especially high in children. The current seven-valent conjugate vaccine is highly effective against invasive disease caused by the vaccine-type strains. However, vaccine coverage is limited, and replacement by non-vaccine serotypes resulting in disease is a serious threat for the near future. Therefore, the search for new vaccine candidates that elicit protection against a broader range of pneumococcal strains is important. Several surface-associated protein vaccines are currently under investigation. Another important issue is whether the aim should be to prevent pneumococcal disease by eradication of nasopharyngeal colonisation, or to prevent bacterial invasion leaving colonisation relatively unaffected and hence preventing the occurrence of replacement colonisation and disease. To illustrate the importance of pneumococcal colonisation in relation to pneumococcal disease and prevention of disease, we discuss the mechanism and epidemiology of colonisation, the complexity of relations within and between species, and the consequences of the different preventive strategies for pneumococcal colonisation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While NCBRS is known to be a recognizable and restricted phenotype, caused by missense mutations in SMARCA2, the term Coffin-Siris syndrome has been used lately for a more heterogeneous group of phenotypes that are caused by mutations in either of the genes ARID1B, ARID1A, ARID2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SOX11 or DPF2. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the phenotypic traits and molecular causes of the above named conditions, consider the question whether a clinical distinction of the phenotypes is still adequate, and suggest the term “SWI/SNF-related intellectual disability disorders” (SSRIDD). We will also outline important features to identify the ARID1B-related phenotype in the absence of classic CSS features, and discuss distinctive and overlapping features of the SSRIDD subtypes. Moreover, we will briefly review the function of the SWI/SNF complex in development and describe the mutational landscapes of the genes involved in SSRIDD.},

  abstract = {Background: Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) remains difficult, particularly in resource-limited settings. The development of nucleic acid-based tests for detection of Myco-bacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) has significantly increased sensitivity compared to conventional smear microscopy and provides results within a matter of hours compared to weeks for the current gold-standard, liquid culture. Methods: In this study we performed side-by-side comparison of mycobacterial detection as-says on sputum samples from 285 subjects presenting with symptoms suggestive of TB in The Gambia and a cross-sectional cohort of 156 confirmed TB patients with a median of 2 months of treatment. A novel assay, Loop-Mediated Amplification test for TB (TB-LAMP), was compared to smear microscopy, MGIT culture and GeneXpert MTB/RIF for all samples. Results: When culture was used as the reference standard, we found an overall sensitivity for TB-LAMP of 99\% (95\% CI: 94.5e99.8) and specificity of 94\% (95\% CI: 89.3e96.7). When latent class analysis was performed, TB-LAMP had 98.6\% (95\% CI: 95.9e100) sensitivity and 99\% (95\% CI: 98.2e100) specificity compared to 91.1\% (95\% CI: 86.1e96) sensitivity and 100\% (95\% CI: 98.2e100) specificity for MGIT culture. GeneXpert had the highest sensitivity 99.1\% (95\% CI: 97.1e100) but the lowest specificity 96\% (95\% CI: 92.6e98.3). Both TB-LAMP and Gen-eXpert showed high sensitivity and specificity regardless of age or strain of infection. Conclusion: Our findings show the diagnostic utility of both GeneXpert and TB-LAMP in The Gambia. Whilst TB-LAMP requires less infrastructure, it is unable to detect drug-resistant pat-terns and therefore would be most suitable as a screening test for new TB cases in peripheral health clinics.},

  abstract = {Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build “geogenetic maps,” which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.},

In this review, we discuss how geographic aspects of the distribution, movement, and reproduction of organisms are reflected in their pedigree across space and time. Because the structure of the pedigree is what determines patterns of relatedness in modern genetic variation, our aim is to thus provide intuition for how these processes leave an imprint in genetic data.

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a principal cause of bacterial middle ear infections, pneumonia, and meningitis. Capsule-targeted pneumococcal vaccines have likely contributed to increased carriage of nonencapsulated S. pneumoniae (NESp). Some NESp lineages are associated with highly efficient DNA uptake and transformation frequencies. However, NESp strains lack capsule that may increase disease severity. We tested the hypothesis that NESp could acquire capsule during systemic infection and transform into more virulent pneumococci. We reveal that NESp strains MNZ67 and MNZ41 are highly transformable and resistant to multiple antibiotics. Natural transformation of NESp when co-administered with heat-killed encapsulated strain WU2 in a murine model of systemic infection resulted in encapsulation of NESp and increased virulence during bacteremia. Functional capsule production increased the pathogenic potential of MNZ67 by significantly decreasing complement deposition on the bacterial surface. However, capsule acquisition did not further decrease complement deposition on the relatively highly pathogenic strain MNZ41. Whole genome sequencing of select transformants demonstrated that recombination of up to 56.7 kbp length occurred at the capsule locus, along with additional recombination occurring at distal sites harboring virulence-associated genes. These findings indicate NESp can compensate for lack of capsule production and rapidly evolve into more virulent strains.},

  abstract = {Here, we provide an update of our review on homeobox genes that we wrote together with Walter Gehring in 1994. Since then, comprehensive surveys of homeobox genes have become possible due to genome sequencing projects. Using the 103 Drosophila homeobox genes as example, we present an updated classification. In animals, there are 16 major classes, ANTP, PRD, PRD-LIKE, POU, HNF, CUT (with four subclasses: ONECUT, CUX, SATB, and CMP), LIM, ZF, CERS, PROS, SIX/SO, plus the TALE superclass with the classes IRO, MKX, TGIF, PBC, and MEIS. In plants, there are 11 major classes, i.e., HD-ZIP (with four subclasses: I to IV), WOX, NDX, PHD, PLINC, LD, DDT, SAWADEE, PINTOX, and the two TALE classes KNOX and BEL. Most of these classes encode additional domains apart from the homeodomain. Numerous insights have been obtained in the last two decades into how homeodomain proteins bind to DNA and increase their specificity by interacting with other proteins to regulate cell- and tissue-specific gene expression. Not only protein-DNA base pair contacts are important for proper target selection; recent experiments also reveal that the shape of the DNA plays a role in specificity. Using selected examples, we highlight different mechanisms of homeodomain protein-DNA interaction. The PRD class of homeobox genes was of special interest to Walter Gehring in the last two decades. The PRD class comprises six families in Bilateria, and tinkers with four different motifs, i.e., the PAIRED domain, the Groucho-interacting motif EH1 (aka Octapeptide or TN), the homeodomain, and the OAR motif. Homologs of the co-repressor protein Groucho are also present in plants (TOPLESS), where they have been shown to interact with small amphipathic motives (EAR), and in yeast (TUP1), where we find an EH1-like motif in MATα2.},

Even if the reason of this inefficient angiogenesis is still unclear, an imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors is probably responsible for inducing a dysregulated angiogenesis in psoriatic arthritis, which seems to be involved in its pathogenesis and clinical features. Nevertheless, among chronic arthritides, while angiogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis has been largely studied with a great amount of literature data, limited data on angiogenesis role in psoriatic arthritis are available.

Based on this, we used a sliding window analysis of Tajima's D across the human genome to identify regions putatively subject to strong, recent, selective sweeps. This survey identified seven Contiguous Regions of Tajima's D Reduction (CRTRs) in an African-descent population (AD), 23 in a European-descent population (ED), and 29 in a Chinese-descent population (XD). Only four CRTRs overlapped between populations: three between ED and XD and one between AD and ED. Full resequencing of eight genes within six CRTRs demonstrated frequency spectra inconsistent with neutral expectations for at least one gene within each CRTR. Identification of the functional polymorphism (and/or haplotype) responsible for the selective sweeps within each CRTR may provide interesting insights into the strongest selective pressures experienced by the human genome over recent evolutionary history.},

Genetic recombination, a process in which exogenous DNA is acquired and incorporated into its genome, is a key evolutionary mechanism employed by the pneumococcus to rapidly adapt to selective pressures. The rate at which the pneumococcus acquires genetic variation through recombination is much higher than the rate at which the organism acquires variation through spontaneous mutations. This higher rate of variation allows the pneumococcus to circumvent the host innate and adaptive immune responses, escape clinical interventions, including antibiotic therapy and vaccine introduction. The rapid influx of whole genome sequence (WGS) data and the advent of novel analysis methods and powerful computational tools for population genetics and evolution studies has transformed our understanding of how genetic recombination drives pneumococcal adaptation and evolution. Here we discuss how genetic recombination has impacted upon the evolution of the pneumococcus.},

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae causes a high burden of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) globally, especially in children from resource-poor settings. Like many bacteria, the pneumococcus can import DNA from other strains or even species by transformation and homologous recombination, which has allowed the pneumococcus to evade clinical interventions such as antibiotics and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). Pneumococci are enclosed in a complex polysaccharide capsule that determines the serotype; the capsule varies in size and is associated with properties including carriage prevalence and virulence. We determined and quantified the association between capsule and recombination events using genomic data from a diverse collection of serotypes sampled in Malawi. We determined both the amount of variation introduced by recombination relative to mutation (the relative rate) and how many individual recombination events occur per isolate (the frequency). Using univariate analyses, we found an association between both recombination measures and multiple factors associated with the capsule, including duration and prevalence of carriage. Because many capsular factors are correlated, we used multivariate analysis to correct for collinearity. Capsule size and carriage duration remained positively associated with recombination, although with a reduced P value, and this effect may be mediated through some unassayed additional property associated with larger capsules. This work describes an important impact of serotype on recombination that has been previously overlooked. While the details of how this effect is achieved remain to be determined, it may have important consequences for the serotype-specific response to vaccines and other interventions. IMPORTANCE The capsule determines {$>$}90 different pneumococcal serotypes, which vary in capsule size, virulence, duration, and prevalence of carriage. Current serotype-specific vaccines elicit anticapsule antibodies. Pneumococcus can take up exogenous DNA by transformation and insert it into its chromosome by homologous recombination. This mechanism has disseminated drug resistance and generated vaccine escape variants. It is hence crucial to pneumococcal evolutionary response to interventions, but there has been no systematic study quantifying whether serotypes vary in recombination and whether this is associated with serotype-specific properties such as capsule size or carriage duration. Larger capsules could physically inhibit DNA uptake, or given the longer carriage duration for larger capsules, this may promote recombination. We find that recombination varies among capsules and is associated with capsule size, carriage duration, and carriage prevalence and negatively associated with invasiveness. The consequence of this work is that serotypes with different capsules may respond differently to selective pressures like vaccines.},

METHODS Fifty-two patients with psoriasis (26 satisfying CASPAR classification criteria for PsA) and 26 healthy controls were recruited for our study. Patients with psoriasis and PsA were group matched for age, sex and psoriasis duration, whereas controls were matched for age and sex. Blood samples were drawn at the time of assessment and serum was analysed for the following: IL-12, IL-12p40, IL-17, TNF super family member 14 (TNFSF14), MMP-3, RANK ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), C-propeptide of Type II collagen (CPII), collagen fragment neoepitopes Col2-3/4(long mono) (C2C) and Col2-3/4(short) (C1-2C) and highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP). Data were analysed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. RESULTS Fifty-two patients with psoriatic disease had a mean age of 46 years and psoriasis duration of 16.8 years. Compared with controls, increased serum levels of RANKL, TNFSF14, MMP-3 and COMP independently associated with psoriatic disease (P \textbackslash textless 0.05). Twenty-six PsA patients (mean swollen and/or tender joint count 16, swollen joint count 5) were then compared with 26 patients who had psoriasis alone. Increased levels of hsCRP, OPG, MMP-3 and the CPII : C2C ratio were independently associated with PsA (P \textbackslash textless 0.03). CONCLUSION This pilot study indicates that hsCRP, OPG, MMP-3 and the CPII : C2C ratio are biomarkers for PsA in patients with psoriasis.},

Here we use genome sequencing of 3,085 pneumococcal carriage isolates from a 2.4 km2 refugee camp to enable unprecedented resolution of the process of recombination, and highlight its impact on population evolution. Genomic recombination hotspots show remarkable consistency between lineages, indicating common selective pressures acting at certain loci, particularly those associated with antibiotic resistance. Temporal changes in antibiotic consumption are reflected in changes in recombination trends demonstrating rapid spread of resistance when selective pressure is high. The highest frequencies of receipt and donation of recombined DNA fragments were observed in non-encapsulated lineages, implying that this largely overlooked pneumococcal group, which is beyond the reach of current vaccines, may play a major role in genetic exchange and adaptation of the species as a whole. These findings advance our understanding of pneumococcal population dynamics and provide important information for the design of future intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes across Africa.   Methods The SITVIT2 global repository and PUBMED were searched for spoligotype and published genotype data respectively, of M. tuberculosis from Africa. M. tuberculosis lineages in Africa were described and compared across regions and with those from 7 European and 6 South-Asian countries. Further analysis of the major lineages and sub-lineages using Principal Component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis were done to describe clustering by geographical regions. Evolutionary relationships were assessed using phylogenetic tree analysis.   Results A total of 14727 isolates from 35 African countries were included in the analysis and of these 13607 were assigned to one of 10 major lineages, whilst 1120 were unknown. There were differences in geographical distribution of major lineages and their sub-lineages with regional clustering. Southern African countries were grouped based on high prevalence of LAM11-ZWE strains; strains which have an origin in Portugal. The grouping of North African countries was due to the high percentage of LAM9 strains, which have an origin in the Eastern Mediterranean region. East African countries were grouped based on Central Asian (CAS) and East-African Indian (EAI) strain lineage possibly reflecting historic sea trade with Asia, while West African Countries were grouped based on Cameroon lineage of unknown origin. A high percentage of the Haarlem lineage isolates were observed in the Central African Republic, Guinea, Gambia and Tunisia, however, a mixed distribution prevented close clustering.   Conclusions This study highlighted that the TB epidemic in Africa is driven by regional epidemics characterized by genetically distinct lineages of M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis in these regions may have been introduced from either Europe or Asia and has spread through pastoralism, mining and war. The vast array of genotypes and their associated phenotypes should be considered when designing future vaccines, diagnostics and anti-TB drugs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}An outbreak of cholera occurred in 1991 in Mexico, where it had not been reported for more than a century and is now endemic. Vibrio cholerae O1 prototype El Tor and classical strains coexist with altered El Tor strains (1991 to 1997). Nontoxigenic (CTX\textsuperscript{−}) V. cholerae El Tor dominated toxigenic (CTX\textsuperscript{+}) strains (2001 to 2003), but V. cholerae CTX\textsuperscript{+} variant El Tor was isolated during 2004 to 2008, outcompeting CTX\textsuperscript{−}V. cholerae. Genomes of six Mexican V. cholerae O1 strains isolated during 1991 to 2008 were sequenced and compared with both contemporary and archived strains of V. cholerae. Three were CTX\textsuperscript{+} El Tor, two were CTX\textsuperscript{−} El Tor, and the remaining strain was a CTX\textsuperscript{+} classical isolate. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed the six isolates belonged to five distinct phylogenetic clades. One CTX\textsuperscript{−} isolate is ancestral to the 6th and 7th pandemic CTX\textsuperscript{+}V. cholerae isolates. The other CTX\textsuperscript{−} isolate joined with CTX\textsuperscript{−} non-O1/O139 isolates from Haiti and seroconverted O1 isolates from Brazil and Amazonia. One CTX\textsuperscript{+} isolate was phylogenetically placed with the sixth pandemic classical clade and the V. cholerae O395 classical reference strain. Two CTX\textsuperscript{+} El Tor isolates possessing intact \emph{Vibrio} seventh pandemic island II (VSP-II) are related to hybrid El Tor isolates from Mozambique and Bangladesh. The third CTX\textsuperscript{+} El Tor isolate contained West African-South American (WASA) recombination in VSP-II and showed relatedness to isolates from Peru and Brazil. Except for one isolate, all Mexican isolates lack SXT/R391 integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) and sensitivity to selected antibiotics, with one isolate resistant to streptomycin. No isolates were related to contemporary isolates from Asia, Africa, or Haiti, indicating phylogenetic diversity.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{IMPORTANCE} Sequencing of genomes of V. cholerae is critical if genetic changes occurring over time in the circulating population of an area of endemicity are to be understood. Although cholera outbreaks occurred rarely in Mexico prior to the 1990s, genetically diverse V. cholerae O1 strains were isolated between 1991 and 2008. Despite the lack of strong evidence, the notion that cholera was transmitted from Africa to Latin America has been proposed in the literature. In this study, we have applied whole-genome sequence analysis to a set of 124 V. cholerae strains, including six Mexican isolates, to determine their phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the six V. cholerae O1 isolates belong to five phylogenetic clades: i.e., basal, nontoxigenic, classical, El Tor, and hybrid El Tor. Thus, the results of phylogenetic analysis, coupled with CTXϕ array and antibiotic susceptibility, do not support single-source transmission of cholera to Mexico from African countries. The association of indigenous populations of V. cholerae that has been observed in this study suggests it plays a significant role in the dynamics of cholera in Mexico.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

  abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ∼356,660 candidate SNPs in ∼117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ∼1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ∼15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ∼4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S ∼0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

SEARCH STRATEGY Using the PubMed database, we searched literature published from 2000 to 2015 using combinations of the key words “psoriasis,” “psoriatic arthritis,” “rheumatoid arthritis,” “pathogenesis,” “immunomodulation,” and “treatment.” INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA This was a non-systematic review and there were no formal inclusion and exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Abstracts identified in the search were screened for relevance and articles considered appropriate evaluated further. References within these selected articles were also screened. Information was extracted from 198 articles for inclusion in this report. DATA SYNTHESIS There was no formal data synthesis. Articles were reviewed and summarized according to disease area (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis). HEADLINE RESULTS The pathophysiology of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis involves chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dysfunction in integrated signaling pathways affecting different constituents of the immune system result in varying clinical features in the three diseases. Co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, malignancies, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are increased. Increased understanding of the immunopathogenesis allowed development of targeted treatments; however, despite a variety of potentially predictive genetic, protein and cellular biomarkers, there is still significant unmet need in these three inflammatory disorders.},

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a common nasopharyngeal commensal that can cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Each component of current protein–polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs) generally induces immunity specific to one of the approximately 100 pneumococcal serotypes, and typically eliminates it from carriage and IPD through herd immunity. Overall carriage rates remain stable owing to replacement by non-PCV serotypes. Consequently, the net change in IPD incidence is determined by the relative invasiveness of the pre- and post-PCV-carried pneumococcal populations. In the present study, we identified PCVs expected to minimize the post-vaccine IPD burden by applying Bayesian optimization to an ecological model of serotype replacement that integrated epidemiological and genomic data. We compared optimal formulations for reducing infant-only or population-wide IPD, and identified potential benefits to including non-conserved pneumococcal carrier proteins. Vaccines were also devised to minimize IPD resistant to antibiotic treatment, despite the ecological model assuming that resistance levels in the carried population would be preserved. We found that expanding infant-administered PCV valency is likely to result in diminishing returns, and that complementary pairs of infant- and adult-administered vaccines could be a superior strategy. PCV performance was highly dependent on the circulating pneumococcal population, further highlighting the advantages of a diversity of anti-pneumococcal vaccination strategies.},

We analyzed the whole genomes of 259 M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains and used this data set to characterize global diversity and to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this pathogen. Coalescent analyses indicate that MTBC emerged about 70,000 years ago, accompanied migrations of anatomically modern humans out of Africa and expanded as a consequence of increases in human population density during the Neolithic period. This long coevolutionary history is consistent with MTBC displaying characteristics indicative of adaptation to both low and high host densities.},

  abstract = {Many bacterial species are composed of multiple lineages distinguished by extensive variation in gene content. These often co-circulate in the same habitat, but the evolutionary and ecological processes that shape these complex populations are poorly understood. Addressing these questions is particularly important for Streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal and respiratory pathogen, as the changes in population structure associated with the recent introduction of partial-coverage vaccines have significantly reduced pneumococcal disease. Here we show pneumococcal lineages from multiple populations each have a distinct combination of intermediate frequency genes. Functional analysis suggested these loci were likely subject to negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) through interactions with other bacteria, hosts, or mobile elements. Correspondingly, these genes had similar frequencies in four populations with dissimilar lineage compositions. These frequencies were maintained following substantial alterations in lineage prevalences once vaccination programmes began. Fitting a multilocus NFDS model of post-vaccine population dynamics to three genomic datasets using Approximate Bayesian Computation generated reproducible estimates of the influence of NFDS on pneumococcal evolution, the strength of which varied between loci. Simulations replicated the stable frequency of lineages unperturbed by vaccination, patterns of serotype switching, and clonal replacement. This framework highlights how bacterial ecology affects the impact of clinical interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE There is a high prevalence of undiagnosed psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients with psoriasis. Identifying soluble biomarkers for PsA will help in screening psoriasis patients for appropriate rheumatology referral. We therefore aimed to investigate whether serum levels of novel markers previously discovered by quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of synovial fluid and skin biopsies performs better than the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in differentiating PsA patients from those with psoriasis without PsA (PsC). METHODS In this case-control study, serum samples were obtained from 100 subjects with PsA, 100 with PsC, and 100 healthy controls. Patients with PsA and PsC were group matched for age, sex, psoriasis duration, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and were not currently receiving biologic treatment. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 4 high-priority markers (Mac-2-binding protein [M2BP], CD5-like protein [CD5L], myeloperoxidase [MPO], and integrin β5 [ITGβ5]), as well as previously established markers (matrix metalloproteinase 3 [MMP-3] and CRP level) were assayed. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. RESULTS In comparisons to controls, CD5L, ITGβ5, M2BP, MPO, MMP-3, and CRP level were independently associated with PsA, while only CD5L, M2BP, and MPO were independently associated with PsC alone. In comparisons to PsC, ITGβ5, M2BP, and CRP level were independently associated with PsA. ROC analysis of this model shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.80-0.90). The model that included CRP level alone had an AUC of 0.71 (95\% CI 0.64-0.78). CONCLUSION CD5L, ITGβ5, M2BP, MPO, MMP-3, and CRP level are markers for PsA. The combination of ITGβ5, M2BP, and CRP level differentiates PsA from PsC, and performs better than CRP level alone.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a distinct inflammatory arthritis occurring in 30\% of psoriasis patients. There is a high prevalence of undiagnosed PsA in psoriasis patients; therefore, identifying soluble biomarkers for PsA could help in screening psoriasis patients for appropriate referral to a rheumatologist. Potential PsA biomarkers likely originate in sites of inflammation, such as the skin, and subsequently enter systemic circulation. Our goal was to identify candidate PsA biomarkers by comparing the proteome of skin biopsies obtained from patients with PsA to that from patients with psoriasis without PsA. METHODS Skin biopsies were obtained from involved and uninvolved skin of 10 PsA and 10 age/gender-matched psoriasis patients without PsA (PsC). Using strong cation exchange chromatography, followed by label-free quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized the proteomes of pooled skin samples. Extracted ion current intensities were used to calculate protein abundance ratios, and these were utilized to identify differentially regulated proteins. RESULTS Forty-seven proteins were elevated in PsA-derived skin compared to PsC-derived skin. Selected reaction monitoring assays were developed to quantify these potential PsA markers in individual skin samples, and 8 markers were confirmed in an independent sample set. ITGB5 and POSTN were measured in serum samples from 33 PsA and 15 PsC patients, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ITGB5 was significantly elevated in PsA serum (P \textbackslash textless 0.01), and POSTN showed a trend. ITGB5 and POSTN correlated significantly in both patient groups (r = 0.472, P \textbackslash textless 0.001). CONCLUSION Proteomic analysis of PsA and PsC skin identified eight new candidate biomarkers. These markers need to be validated with a larger and independent cohort, in order to delineate their clinical utility in PsA patients. These proteins may also uncover unknown aspects of PsA pathobiology.},

The application of similar methods to bacteria has been hindered in the main by the lack of high-resolution nucleotide sequence data from quality samples. Developing and already available genomic methods have greatly increased the amount of data that can be used to characterize an isolate and its relationship to others. However, differences in sequencing platforms and data analysis mean that these enhanced data come with a cost in terms of portability: results from one laboratory may not be directly comparable with those from another. Moreover, genomic data for many bacteria bear the mark of a history including extensive recombination, which has the potential to greatly confound phylogenetic and coalescent analyses. Here, we discuss the exacting requirements of genomic epidemiology, and means by which the distorting signal of recombination can be minimized to permit the leverage of growing datasets of genomic data from bacterial pathogens.},

Gubbins is an iterative algorithm that uses spatial scanning statistics to identify loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions suggestive of horizontal sequence transfer while concurrently constructing a maximum likelihood phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside these regions of high sequence diversity. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistically parameterized models of bacterial evolution, and achieves convergence in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences.

We investigated the role of mutations in the embC-embA intergenic region (IGR) in EMB-resistant clinical strains from east China. A total of 767 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were collected and analyzed for their drug susceptibility to EMB using the MGIT 960 system and MIC assay, and the embC-embA IGRs of these strains were sequenced. The transcriptional activity of the embC-embA IGR mutations was examined by reporter gene assays in recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis strains, and the effect of IGR mutations on its binding to EmbR, a transcription regulator of embAB, was analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. Correlation coefficient analysis showed that the embC-embA IGR mutation is associated with EMB resistance. The clinical strains carrying IGR mutations had a much higher level of embA and embB mRNA as well as higher MICs to EMB. IGR mutations had higher transcriptional activity when transformed into M. smegmatis strains. Mutated IGRs bound to EmbR with much higher affinity than wild-type fragments. The sensitivity of molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) with IGR mutations as an additional marker increased from 65.5\% to 73.5\%. Mutations of the embC-embA IGR enhance the binding of EmbR to the promoter region of embAB and increase the expression of embAB, thus contributing to EMB resistance. Therefore, identification of IGR mutations as markers of EMB resistance could increase the sensitivity of molecular DST.},

  abstract = {Psoriasis is now classified as an immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) of the skin. It is being recognized that patients with various IMIDs, including psoriasis, are at higher risk of developing "systemic" co-morbidities, e.g., cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome, and overt diabetes. In non-psoriatic individuals, the pathophysiology of obesity, aberrant adipocyte metabolism, diabetes, and CVDs involves immune-mediated or inflammatory pathways. IMIDs may impact these co-morbid conditions through shared genetic risks, common environmental factors, or common inflammatory pathways that are co-expressed in IMIDs and target organs. Given that pathogenic immune pathways in psoriasis are now well worked out and a large number of inflammatory mediators have been identified in skin lesions, in this review we will consider possible mechanistic links between skin inflammation and increased risks of (1) obesity or metabolic alterations and (2) CVD. In particular, we will discuss how well-established risk factors for CVD can originate from inflammation in other tissues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis has challenged tuberculosis control strategies globally. The present study aims to analyze the frequency of mutations in rpoB, katG and inhA genes in strains of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) circulating in Central India. It is anticipated that the findings may provide a starting point to understand the evolutionary success of drug-resistant strains of MTBC in this region. METHODS Line probe assay was carried out on 720 consecutive sputum samples of MDR suspects from June 2012 to May 2013. Mutation frequencies in the rpoB, katG and inhA genes were analyzed. RESULTS Mutations were identified in 269 (37.6\%) samples, as follows: 55 (7.6\%) samples had mutations conferring resistance to only isoniazid, 84 (11.6\%) had mutations conferring resistance to only rifampicin and 130 (18\%) isolates had mutations conferring resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin. The most frequent mutation in the rpoB gene was at codon S531L, seen in 141 (19.5\%) isolates. The most frequent mutation in the katG gene was at codon S315T1, seen in 151 (20.9\%) isolates; and in the inhA gene at codon C15T, seen in 21 (2.9\%) isolates. Some unidentified mutations were also observed. CONCLUSION The patterns and the frequency of the mutations identified in this study indicate the most frequent mutations at S531L codon in the rpoB gene, S315T1 codon in the katG gene and C15T codon in the promoter region of the inhA gene. Controlling the emergence and spread of MDR TB requires an understanding of the evolution of these mutations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& OBJECTIVES Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex may sometimes not be detected in sputum samples of suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients by line probe assay (LPA) even though they are smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). This retrospective analysis was attempted to understand and document our experience with LPA for detection of M. tuberculosis complex and diagnosis of MDR-TB under programmatic conditions. METHODS One thousand two hundred and ninety four sputum samples of MDR-TB suspects that were smear positive for AFB, and received from February to November 2013, were tested by LPA for the presence of M. tuberculosis complex and resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin as per the diagnostic mandate of an accredited reference laboratory. As per the mandate, those samples that were negative for M. tuberculosis complex were cultured, and the growth again tested by LPA. A retrospective analysis of the results was carried out. RESULTS M. tuberculosis complex could be detected in 1217 (94.04\%) but not in 77 (5.9\%) of smear-positive sputum samples. Of the 1217 positive samples, 232 (19.1\%) were MDR, 130 (10.6\%) were rifampicin monoresistant and 101 (8.3\%) were INH monoresistant. Seven hundred and fifty four (61.9\%) strains were found to be pansensitive. Overall, 5.1 per cent of the sputum samples were negative for M. tuberculosis complex by LPA and culture. In at least 10 (0.77\%) sputum samples smear positive for AFB, M. tuberculosis complex could not be identified by LPA though M. tuberculosis was present, as evidenced by culture positivity. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSIONS LPA is a robust technique for diagnosis of drug-resistant TB that has provided the basis for rapid and effective control of drug-resistant TB in India. While the reasons for concomitantly negative LPA and culture results of smear-positive sputum samples from MDR-TB suspects may be many, the possible presence of non-tubercular mycobacteria in these samples and the likelihood of inappropriate therapy in these patients cannot be ruled out. Addition of culture to the diagnostic algorithm may enhance the diagnostic yield.},

The tool of choice for such a study is often to build a phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when possible a dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all common ancestors are estimated. Here, we propose a new Bayesian methodology to construct dated phylogenies which is specifically designed for bacterial genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at building dated phylogenies, we consider that the phylogenetic relationships between the genomes have been previously evaluated using a standard phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology much faster and scalable. This two-step approach also allows us to directly exploit existing phylogenetic methods that detect bacterial recombination, and therefore to account for the effect of recombination in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We analysed many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the performance of our approach in a wide range of situations. Furthermore, we present applications to three different real datasets from recent bacterial genomic studies. Our methodology is implemented in a R package called BactDating which is freely available for download at https://github.com/xavierdidelot/BactDating.},

  abstract = {Epidemics and pandemics of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease, have occurred since the early 19th century and waves of epidemic disease continue today. Cholera epidemics are caused by individual, genetically monomorphic lineages of Vibrio cholerae: the ongoing seventh pandemic, which has spread globally since 1961, is associated with lineage L2 of biotype El Tor. Previous genomic studies of the epidemiology of the seventh pandemic identified three successive sub-lineages within L2, designated waves 1 to 3, which spread globally from the Bay of Bengal on multiple occasions. However, these studies did not include samples from China, which also experienced multiple epidemics of cholera in recent decades. We sequenced the genomes of 71 strains isolated in China between 1961 and 2010, as well as eight from other sources, and compared them with 181 published genomes. The results indicated that outbreaks in China between 1960 and 1990 were associated with wave 1 whereas later outbreaks were associated with wave 2. However, the previously defined waves overlapped temporally, and are an inadequate representation of the shape of the global genealogy. We therefore suggest replacing them by a series of tightly delineated clades. Between 1960 and 1990 multiple such clades were imported into China, underwent further microevolution there and then spread to other countries. China was thus both a sink and source during the pandemic spread of V. cholerae, and needs to be included in reconstructions of the global patterns of spread of cholera.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. The genomes of 44 diverse strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the Mitis group. RESULTS: Despite evidence of extensive recombination, the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. Most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all S. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of S. pneumoniae. The open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.},

  abstract = {Researchers have learned that nearly all conditions and diseases have a genetic component. With the benefit of technological advances, many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with the risk of complex disorders by using genome wide association studies (GWASs). Disease-associated SNPs are sometimes shared by healthy controls and cannot clearly distinguish affected individuals from unaffected ones. The combined effects of multiple independent SNPs contribute to the disease process, but revealing the relationship between genotype and phenotype based on the combinations remains a great challenge. In this study, by considering the disease prevalence rate, we conducted an exhaustive process to identify whether a genotype combination pattern would have a decisive effect on complex disorders. Based on genotype data for 68 reported SNPs in 8,372 psoriasis patients and 8,510 healthy controls, we found that putative causal genotype combination patterns (CGCPs) were only present in psoriasis patients, not in healthy subjects. These results suggested that psoriasis might be contributed by combined genotypes, complementing the traditional modest susceptibility of a single variant in a single gene for a complex disease. This work is the first systematic study to analyze genotype combinations based on the reported susceptibility genes, considering each individual among the cases and controls from the Chinese population, and could potentially advance disease-gene mapping and precision medicine due to the causality relationship between the candidate CGCPs and complex diseases.},

  abstract = {Insertion/deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length, yet are highly prevalent in healthy populations, presenting a challenge to bioinformatics classifiers. Commonly used features–DNA and protein sequence conservation, indel length, and occurrence in repeat regions–are useful for inference of protein damage. However, these features can cause false positives when predicting the impact of indels on disease. Existing methods for indel classification suffer from low specificities, severely limiting clinical utility. Here, we further develop our variant effect scoring tool (VEST) to include the classification of in-frame and frameshift indels (VEST-indel) as pathogenic or benign. We apply 24 features, including a new "PubMed" feature, to estimate a gene's importance in human disease. When compared with four existing indel classifiers, our method achieves a drastically reduced false-positive rate, improving specificity by as much as 90\%. This approach of estimating gene importance might be generally applicable to missense and other bioinformatics pathogenicity predictors, which often fail to achieve high specificity. Finally, we tested all possible meta-predictors that can be obtained from combining the four different indel classifiers using Boolean conjunctions and disjunctions, and derived a meta-predictor with improved performance over any individual method.},

  abstract = {Monitoring changes in pneumococcal carriage is key to understanding vaccination-induced shifts in the ecology of carriage and impact on health. We longitudinally investigated pneumococcal carriage dynamics in infants. Pneumococcal isolates were obtained from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected 2-weekly from 137 infants enrolled from birth through their first year of life. Pneumococci were serotyped by sequetyping, confirmed by Quellung. Pneumococci were isolated from 54\% (1809/3331) of infants. Median time to first acquisition was 63 days. Serotype-specific acquisition rates ranged from 0.01 to 0.88 events/child-year and did not differ between PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotypes (0.11 events/child-year [95\% CI 0.07–0.18] vs. 0.11 events/child-year [95\% CI 0.06–0.18]). There was no difference in carriage duration between individual PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotypes (40.6 days [95\% CI 31.9–49.4] vs. 38.6 days [95\% CI 35.1–42.1]), however cumulatively the duration of carriage of non-PCV13 serotypes was greater than PCV13 serotypes (141.2 days (95\% CI 126.6–155.8) vs. 30.7 days (95\% CI 22.3–39.0). Frequently carried PCV13 serotypes included 19F, 9V, 19A and 6A, while non-PCV13 serotypes included 15B/15C, 21, 10A, 16F, 35B, 9N and 15A. Despite high immunization coverage in our setting, PCV13 serotypes remain in circulation in this cohort, comprising 22\% of isolates. Individual PCV13 serotypes were acquired, on average, at equivalent rate to non-PCV13 serotypes, and carried for a similar duration, although the most common non-PCV13 serotypes were more frequently acquired than PCV13 serotypes.},

This population-based study identified patients with pso-riasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier life table techniques were used. The study comprised 10,011 psoriasis patients (severe n = 4,618), and 1,269 patients also had PsA. Incidence of PsA increased with duration of cutaneous symptoms (p = 0.0001). Psoriasis diagnosed before age 20 or 30 years, respectively, suggested a lower risk of PsA than psoriasis diagnosed after age 50 years, yet age at first cutaneous symptoms did not predict development of PsA. No clear association with disease severity was found. PsA incidence appeared stable with longer duration of psoriasis, but further data are needed to firmly establish the relationship with age of psoriasis onset.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune hyperproliferative skin disease. In psoriasis, the cutaneous and systemic overexpression of various proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been demonstrated. Methotrexate (MTX) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of MTX on serum IL-6 levels and also to find the association between PASI score and IL-6 levels in psoriatic patients during MTX therapy. METHODS We recruited 20 control subjects and 22 Psoriasis vulgaris patients for this study. The patients were treated with 7.5mg of methotrexate per week for 12weeks. Folic acid was given at 5mg once daily except on the day of MTX for 12weeks. There were 2 dropouts, because of increased liver enzyme levels. Blood samples were collected at three intervals (i.e., Day 0, 6weeks, 12weeks) from psoriatic patients and only once from control subjects. PASI score, biochemical and hematological parameters were assessed. Serum IL-6 level was analyzed by using ELISA. RESULTS Biochemical and hematological parameters showed no significant changes. Serum IL-6 level and PASI score declined significantly (p\textbackslash textless0.001) from Day 0 to 12weeks of MTX treatment and also showed positive correlation before (r=0.992; p\textbackslash textless0.000) and after (r=0.987; p\textbackslash textless0.000) treatment with MTX. Out of 4 clinical indices of PASI, only 2 indices namely Infiltration (I) and Desquamation (D) showed positive correlation with IL-6 before and after MTX treatment. CONCLUSION The treatment response with MTX in psoriatic patients can be seen both at clinical and molecular levels.},

Accurate identification of pneumococcal serotypes is important for tracking the distribution and evolution of serotypes following the introduction of effective vaccines. Recent efforts have been made to infer serotypes directly from genomic data but current software approaches are limited and do not scale well. Here, we introduce a novel method, SeroBA, which uses a k-mer approach. We compare SeroBA against real and simulated data and present results on the concordance and computational performance against a validation dataset, the robustness and scalability when analysing a large dataset, and the impact of varying the depth of coverage on sequence-based serotyping. SeroBA can predict serotypes, by identifying the cps locus, directly from raw whole genome sequencing read data with 98{$\mkern1mu\%$} concordance using a k-mer-based method, can process 10{$\mkern1mu$}000 samples in just over 1\,day using a standard server and can call serotypes at a coverage as low as 15–21×.

Subsequently the disease reached the Philippines, progressing from Manila southwards to the other islands, whence it invaded British Borneo. The El Tor epidemic did not differ clinically or epidemiologically from other cholera outbreaks observed during the past decade. The disease attacked poor, under-nourished people living under insanitary conditions. It spread along the coastline and, to a limited extent, along inland waterways. The authorities in the affected territories recommended that the quarantine regulations, sanitary measures and treatment methods used against cholera caused by the so-called “true” cholera vibrios be applied also to cholera caused by El Tor vibrios.},

This article describes a framework named PERCH (Polymorphism Evaluation, Ranking, and Classification for a Heritable trait), available at http://BJFengLab.org/. It can prioritize disease genes by quantitatively unifying a new deleteriousness measure called BayesDel, an improved assessment of the biological relevance of genes to the disease, a modified linkage analysis, a novel rare-variant association test, and a converted variant call quality score. It supports data that contain various combinations of extended pedigrees, trios, and case-controls, and allows for a reduced penetrance, an elevated phenocopy rate, liability classes, and covariates. BayesDel is more accurate than PolyPhen2, SIFT, FATHMM, LRT, Mutation Taster, Mutation Assessor, PhyloP, GERP++, SiPhy, CADD, MetaLR, and MetaSVM. The overall approach is faster and more powerful than the existing quantitative method pVAAST, as shown by the simulations of challenging situations in finding the missing heritability of a complex disease. This framework can also classify variants of unknown significance (variants of uncertain significance) by quantitatively integrating allele frequencies, deleteriousness, association, and co-segregation. PERCH is a versatile tool for gene prioritization in gene discovery research and variant classification in clinical genetic testing.},

  abstract = {Experimental animal models of tuberculosis (TB) have convincingly demonstrated that inhaled dose predicts immunopathology and survival. In contrast, the importance of inhaled dose has generally not been appreciated in TB epidemiology, clinical science, or the practice of TB control. Infectiousness of TB patients has traditionally been assessed using microscopy for acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, which should be considered only a risk factor. We have recently demonstrated that cough aerosol cultures from index cases with pulmonary TB are the best predictors of new infection among household contacts. We suggest that cough aerosols of M. tuberculosis are the best surrogates of inhaled dose, and we hypothesize that the quantity of cough aerosols is associated with TB infection versus disease. Although several factors affect the quality of infectious aerosols, we propose that the particle size distribution of cough aerosols is an important predictor of primary upper airway disease and cervical lymphadenitis and of immune responses in exposed hosts. We hypothesize that large droplet aerosols ({$>$}5\,μ) containing M. tuberculosis deposit in the upper airway and can induce immune responses without establishing infection. We suggest that this may partially explain the large proportion of humans who never develop TB disease in spite of having immunological evidence of M. tuberculosis infection (e.g., positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay). If these hypotheses are proven true, they would alter the current paradigm of latent TB infection and reactivation, further demonstrating the need for better biomarkers or methods of assessing TB infection and the risk of developing disease.},

  abstract = {This review focuses on the genetic features of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and their relationship to phenotypic heterogeneity in the disease, and addresses three questions: what do the recent studies on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tell us about the genetic relationship between cutaneous psoriasis (PsO) and PsA - that is, is PsO a unitary phenotype; is PsA a genetically heterogeneous or homogeneous entity; and do the genetic factors implicated in determining susceptibility to PsA predict clinical phenotype? We first discuss the results from comparing the HLA typing of two PsO cohorts: one cohort providing the dermatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsO without evidence of arthritic disease; and the second cohort providing the rheumatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsA. We show that these two cohorts differ considerably in their predominant HLA alleles, indicating the heterogeneity of the overall PsO phenotype. Moreover, the genotype of patients in the PsA cohort was shown to be heterogeneous with significant elevations in the frequency of haplotypes containing HLA-B*08, HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38 and HLA-B*39. Because different genetic susceptibility genes imply different disease mechanisms, and possibly different clinical courses and therapeutic responses, we then review the evidence for a phenotypic difference among patients with PsA who have inherited different HLA alleles. We provide evidence that different alleles and, more importantly, different haplotypes implicated in determining PsA susceptibility are associated with different phenotypic characteristics that appear to be subphenotypes. The implication of these findings for the overall pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in PsA is discussed with specific reference to their bearing on the discussion of whether PsA is conceptualised as an autoimmune process or one that is based on entheseal responses.},

We demonstrate that M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 2 (East Asian lineage and Beijing sublineage) acquire drug resistances in vitro more rapidly than M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) and that this higher rate can be attributed to a higher mutation rate. Moreover, the in vitro mutation rate correlates well with the bacterial mutation rate in humans as determined by whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates. Finally, using a stochastic mathematical model, we demonstrate that the observed differences in mutation rate predict a substantially higher probability that patients infected with a drug-susceptible lineage 2 strain will harbor multidrug-resistant bacteria at the time of diagnosis. These data suggest that interventions to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis should target bacterial as well as treatment-related risk factors.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale diversity data are increasingly available in a variety of biological systems, and can be used to reconstruct the past evolutionary history of species divergence. However, extracting the full demographic information from these data is not trivial, and requires inferential methods that account for the diversity of coalescent histories throughout the genome. Here, we evaluate the potential and limitations of one such approach. We reexamine a well-known system of mussel sister species, using the joint site frequency spectrum (jSFS) of synonymous mutations computed either from exome capture or RNA-seq, in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We first assess the best sampling strategy (number of: individuals, loci, and bins in the jSFS), and show that model selection is robust to variation in the number of individuals and loci. In contrast, different binning choices when summarizing the jSFS, strongly affect the results: including classes of low and high frequency shared polymorphisms can more effectively reveal recent migration events. We then take advantage of the flexibility of ABC to compare more realistic models of speciation, including variation in migration rates through time (i.e., periodic connectivity) and across genes (i.e., genome-wide heterogeneity in migration rates). We show that these models were consistently selected as the most probable, suggesting that mussels have experienced a complex history of gene flow during divergence and that the species boundary is semi-permeable. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of ABC demographic inference in mussels based on the coding jSFS, and supplies guidelines for employing different sequencing techniques and sampling strategies. We emphasize, perhaps surprisingly, that inferences are less limited by the volume of data, than by the way in which they are analyzed.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing enables complete characterization of genetic variation, but geographic clustering of rare alleles demands many diverse populations be studied. Here we describe the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) Project, in which we sequenced the whole genomes of 250 Dutch parent-offspring families and constructed a haplotype map of 20.4 million single-nucleotide variants and 1.2 million insertions and deletions. The intermediate coverage (∼13×) and trio design enabled extensive characterization of structural variation, including midsize events (30-500 bp) previously poorly catalogued and de novo mutations. We demonstrate that the quality of the haplotypes boosts imputation accuracy in independent samples, especially for lower frequency alleles. Population genetic analyses demonstrate fine-scale structure across the country and support multiple ancient migrations, consistent with historical changes in sea level and flooding. The GoNL Project illustrates how single-population whole-genome sequencing can provide detailed characterization of genetic variation and may guide the design of future population studies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. These pluripotent cells secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which regulates cell growth, survival, motility, migration, mitogenesis and is important for tissue development/regeneration. HGF has four splice variants, NK1, NK2, NK3, and NK4 which have varying functions and affinities for the HGF receptor, cMET. HGF promotes osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs into bone forming cells, playing a role in bone development, health and repair. AREAS COVERED This review will focus on the effects of HGF in osteogenesis, bone repair and bone health, including structural and functional insights into the role of HGF in the body. EXPERT OPINION Approximately 6.2 million Americans experience a fracture annually, with 5-10\% being mal- or non-union fractures. HGF is important in priming MSCs for osteogenic differentiation in vitro and is currently being studied to assess its role during bone repair in vivo. Due to the high turnover rate of systemic HGF, non-classic modes of HGF-treatment, including naked-plasmid HGF delivery and the use of HGF splice variants (NK1 \& NK2) are being studied to find safe and efficacious treatments for bone disorders, such as mal- or non-union fractures.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash textlessp\textbackslash textgreaterHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) promotes pleiotropic signaling through its specific receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. As such, it has important roles in the regeneration of injured tissues. Since HGF is produced mainly by mesenchymal cells and MET is expressed in most epithelial, endothelial and somatic stem cells, HGF functions as a typical paracrine growth factor. HGF is secreted as an inactive precursor (proHGF) and requires proteolytic activation to initiate HGF-induced MET signaling. HGF activator (HGFAC) is a serum activator of proHGF and produces robust HGF activities in injured tissues. HGFAC is a coagulation factor XII-like serine endopeptidase that circulates in the plasma as a zymogen (proHGFAC). Thrombin, kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK)-4 or KLK-5 efficiently activates proHGFAC. The activated HGFAC cleaves proHGF at Arg494-Val495, resulting in the formation of the active disulfide-linked heterodimer HGF. Macrophage stimulating protein, a ligand of RON, is also activated by HGFAC in vivo. Although HGFAC functions primarily at the site of damaged tissue, a recent report has suggested that activated HGFAC relays a signal to stem cells in non-injured tissues via proHGF activation in the stem cell niche. This review focuses on current knowledge regarding HGFAC-mediated proHGF activation and its roles in tissue regeneration and repair.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

Studies have reported human pathogens to have geographically structured population genetics, some of which have been linked to ancient human migrations. However, no study has addressed the potential evolutionary consequences of such longstanding human-pathogen associations. Here, we demonstrate that the global population structure of M. tuberculosis is defined by six phylogeographical lineages, each associated with specific, sympatric human populations. In an urban cosmopolitan environment, mycobacterial lineages were much more likely to spread in sympatric than in allopatric patient populations. Tuberculosis cases that did occur in allopatric hosts disproportionately involved high-risk individuals with impaired host resistance. These observations suggest that mycobacterial lineages are adapted to particular human populations. If confirmed, our findings have important implications for tuberculosis control and vaccine development.},

  abstract = {The goals of the End TB strategy, which aims to achieve a 90\% reduction in tuberculosis (TB) incidence and a 95\% reduction in TB mortality by 2035, will not be achieved without new tools to fight TB. These include improved point of care (POC) diagnostic tests that are meant to be delivered at the most decentralised levels of care where the patients make the initial contact with the health system, as well as within the community. These tests should be able to be performed on an easily accessible sample and provide results in a timely manner, allowing a quick treatment turnaround time of a few minutes or hours (in a single clinical encounter), hence avoiding patient loss-to-follow-up. There have been exciting developments in recent years, including the WHO endorsement of Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) and lateral flow lipoarabinomannan (LAM). However, these tests have limitations that must be overcome before they can be optimally applied at the POC. Furthermore, worrying short- to medium-term gaps exist in the POC diagnostic test development pipeline. Thus, not only is better implementation of existing tools and algorithms needed, but new research is required to develop new POC tests that allow the TB community to truly make an impact and find the “missed TB cases”.},

The development of acute pancreatitis (AP, an important pathological inflammatory state of the exocrine pancreas) would be based on early changes in protein expression and signaling pathways whose unmasking would be crucial for deciphering AP at the molecular level. We reported here a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomics analysis of rat subcellular fractions of the pancreas during the early phase of experimental AP, using a sixplex isobaric chemical labeling technique. We identified 997 unique proteins, of which 353 were significantly different (22, 276 or 55 in both, the soluble or the membrane fractions, respectively). Accordingly, using TMT proteomics and bioinformatic tools, in García-Hernández et al., 2018- [1] we were able to detect significant changes in protein expression related to many pathobiological pathways of AP as from the early phase of the disease, including some changes never described before in this disease.

  abstract = {Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a close relative of the major human pathogen S. pneumoniae. It is increasingly associated with lower-respiratory-tract infections (LRTI) and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). S. pseudopneumoniae is difficult to identify using traditional typing methods due to similarities with S. pneumoniae and other members of the mitis group (SMG). Using whole-genome sequencing of LRTI isolates and a comparative genomic approach, we found that a large number of pneumococcal virulence and colonization genes are present in the core S. pseudopneumoniae genome. We also reveal an impressive number of novel surface-exposed proteins encoded by the genome of this species. In addition, we propose a new and entirely specific molecular marker useful for the identification of S. pseudopneumoniae. Phylogenetic analyses of S. pseudopneumoniae show that specific clades are associated with allelic variants of core proteins. Resistance to tetracycline and macrolides, the two most common types of resistance, were found to be encoded by Tn916-like integrating conjugative elements and Mega-2. Overall, we found a tight association of genotypic determinants of AMR and phenotypic AMR with a specific lineage of S. pseudopneumoniae. Taken together, our results shed light on the distribution in S. pseudopneumoniae of genes known to be important during invasive disease and colonization and provide insight into features that could contribute to virulence, colonization, and adaptation. IMPORTANCE S. pseudopneumoniae is an overlooked pathogen emerging as the causative agent of lower-respiratory-tract infections and associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and exacerbation of COPD. However, much remains unknown on its clinical importance and epidemiology, mainly due to the lack of specific markers to distinguish it from S. pneumoniae. Here, we provide a new molecular marker entirely specific for S. pseudopneumoniae and offer a comprehensive view of the virulence and colonization genes found in this species. Finally, our results pave the way for further studies aiming at understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of S. pseudopneumoniae.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don9t account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. METHODS: We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14\hphantom{,}294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS: Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95\% uncertainty interval 61·4-61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5-72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7-17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5-70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1\% (2·6-5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0\% (15·8-18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1\% (12·6-16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1\% (11·9-14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1\%, 39·1-44·6), malaria (43·1\%, 34·7-51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8\%, 24·8-34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1\%, 19·3-37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146\hphantom{,}000 deaths, 118\hphantom{,}000-183\hphantom{,}000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393\hphantom{,}000 deaths, 228\hphantom{,}000-532\hphantom{,}000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. INTERPRETATION: At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

In West Africa, due to a poor laboratory infrastructure and inadequate capacity, such data are scarce. Therefore, the true extent of drug-resistant TB was hitherto undetermined. In 2008, a new research network, the West African Network of Excellence for Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria (WANETAM), was founded, comprising nine study sites from eight West African countries (Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo). The goal was to establish Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) principles and build capacity in standardised smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture across partnering laboratories to generate the first comprehensive West African drug-resistance data. Methods: Following GCLP and laboratory training sessions, TB isolates were collected at sentinel referral sites between 2009–2013 and tested for first-and second-line drug resistance.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium africanum is an important cause of tuberculosis (TB) in West Africa. So far, two lineages called M. africanum West African 1 (MAF1) and M. africanum West African 2 (MAF2) have been defined. Although several molecular studies on MAF2 have been conducted to date, little is known about MAF1. As MAF1 is mainly present in countries around the Gulf of Guinea we aimed to estimate its prevalence in Cotonou, the biggest city in Benin. Between 2005–06 we collected strains in Cotonou/Benin and genotyped them using spoligo- and 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR-typing. Analyzing 194 isolates, we found that 31\% and 6\% were MAF1 and MAF2, respectively. Therefore Benin is one of the countries with the highest prevalence (37\%) of M. africanum in general and MAF1 in particular. Moreover, we combined our data from Benin with publicly available genotyping information from Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and determined the phylogeographic population structure and genotypic clustering of MAF1. Within the MAF1 lineage, we identified an unexpected great genetic variability with the presence of at least 10 sub-lineages. Interestingly, 8 out of 10 of the discovered sub-lineages not only clustered genetically but also geographically. Besides showing a remarkable local restriction to certain regions in Benin and Nigeria, the sub-lineages differed dramatically in their capacity to transmit within the human host population. While identifying Benin as one of the countries with the highest overall prevalence of M. africanum, this study also contains the first detailed description of the transmission dynamics and phylogenetic composition of the MAF1 lineage.},

  abstract = {Background Phylogenetically distinct Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages differ in their phenotypes and pathogenicity. Consequently, understanding mycobacterial population structures phylogeographically is essential for design, interpretation and generalizability of clinical trials. Comprehensive efforts are lacking to date to establish the West African mycobacterial population structure on a sub-continental scale, which has diagnostic implications and can inform the design of clinical TB trials.   Methodology/Principal Findings We collated novel and published genotyping (spoligotyping) data and classified spoligotypes into mycobacterial lineages/families using TBLineage and Spotclust, followed by phylogeographic analyses using statistics (logistic regression) and lineage axis plot analysis in GenGIS, in which a phylogenetic tree constructed in MIRU-VNTRplus was analysed. Combining spoligotyping data from 16 previously published studies with novel data from The Gambia, we obtained a total of 3580 isolates from 12 countries and identified 6 lineages comprising 32 families. By using stringent analytical tools we demonstrate for the first time a significant phylogeographic separation between western and eastern West Africa not only of the two M. africanum (West Africa 1 and 2) but also of several major M. tuberculosis sensu stricto families, such as LAM10 and Haarlem 3. Moreover, in a longitudinal logistic regression analysis for grouped data we showed that M. africanum West Africa 2 remains a persistent health concern.   Conclusions/Significance Because of the geographical divide of the mycobacterial populations in West Africa, individual research findings from one country cannot be generalized across the whole region. The unequal geographical family distribution should be considered in placement and design of future clinical trials in West Africa.},

Using the rhesus macaque model we show that prior infection with Zika virus leads to a significant enhancement of Dengue-2 viremia that is accompanied by neutropenia, lympocytosis, hyperglycemia, and higher reticulocyte counts, along with the activation of pro-inflammatory monocyte subsets and release of inflammatory mediators. Zika virus infection induced detectable Dengue cross-reactive serum IgG responses that significantly amplified after Dengue-2 virus infection. Serum from Zika virus immune animals collected prior to Dengue-2 infection showed significant capacity for in vitro antibody dependent enhancement of Dengue-1, 2, 3 and 4 serotypes suggesting that pre-existing immunity to Zika virus could potentially enhance infection by heterologous Dengue serotypes. Our results provide first in vivo evidence that prior exposure to Zika virus infection can enhance Dengue infection, which has implications for understanding pathogenesis and the development of vaccines.},

  abstract = {Clinical analysis of blood is the most widespread diagnostic procedure in medicine, and blood biomarkers are used to categorize patients and to support treatment decisions. However, existing biomarkers are far from comprehensive and often lack specificity and new ones are being developed at a very slow rate. As described in this review, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful technology in biological research and it is now poised to allow the characterization of the plasma proteome in great depth. Previous "triangular strategies" aimed at discovering single biomarker candidates in small cohorts, followed by classical immunoassays in much larger validation cohorts. We propose a "rectangular" plasma proteome profiling strategy, in which the proteome patterns of large cohorts are correlated with their phenotypes in health and disease. Translating such concepts into clinical practice will require restructuring several aspects of diagnostic decision-making, and we discuss some first steps in this direction.},

Its exact prevalence is unknown, but estimates vary from 0.3\% to 1\% of the population. The clinical features described initially are recognised by most experienced clinicians, although they are most distinct in early disease. Initially, PsA typically presents as an oligoarticular and mild disease. However, with time PsA becomes polyarticular, and it is a severe disease in at least 20\% of patients. Patients with PsA who present with polyarticular disease are at risk for disease progression. In addition to progression of clinical and radiological damage, health related quality of life is reduced among patients with PsA. It important to note that patients included in recent drug trials resemble patients followed prospectively in a clinic.},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent advances in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over the past several years with emphasis on early diagnosis, better understanding of pathogenesis, and new therapeutic approaches. Early diagnosis is important, since people who present late do not fare as well. There are a number of clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound features that can help identify patients destined to develop PsA, and several screening tools have been developed. It is recognized that genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as T cells and cytokines, play a role in the pathogenesis of PsA, and several targets have been identified for therapeutic interventions. New therapies have been developed and tested in PsA and have been found to be highly effective for both skin and joint manifestations of the disease. The expectation is that, in the future, PsA patients will be treated early and more aggressively and that there will not be significant progression of joint damage. Moreover, with effective treatment of the skin and joint disease and management of risk factors for the comorbidities, we can expect to reduce their occurrence and further reduce the excess mortality and reduced quality of life and function in these patients.},

  abstract = {Migration influences population dynamics on networks, thereby playing a vital role in scenarios ranging from species extinction to epidemic propagation. While low migration rates prevent local populations from becoming extinct, high migration rates enhance the risk of global extinction by synchronizing the dynamics of connected populations. Here, we investigate this trade-off using two mutualistic strains of E. coli that exhibit population oscillations when co-cultured. In experiments, as well as in simulations using a mechanistic model, we observe that high migration rates lead to synchronization whereas intermediate migration rates perturb the oscillations and change their period. Further, our simulations predict, and experiments show, that connected populations subjected to more challenging antibiotic concentrations have the highest probability of survival at intermediate migration rates. Finally, we identify altered population dynamics, rather than recolonization, as the primary cause of extended survival., Migration can increase survival of a metapopulation by enabling recolonization after local extinction. Here, Gokhale et al. use both microbial experiments and mechanistic modeling to show that moderate levels of migration can increase survival by altering oscillatory population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Infection with dengue virus (DENV) or any other flavivirus induces cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing or nonneutralizing, antibodies that recognize epitopes involving the fusion peptide in the envelope glycoprotein. Humanized mAb IgG 1A5, derived from a chimpanzee, shares properties of cross-reactive antibodies. mAb IgG 1A5 up-regulated DENV infection by a mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in a variety of Fc receptor-bearing cells in vitro. A 10- to 1,000-fold increase of viral yield in K562 cells, dependent on the DENV serotype, was observed over a range of subneutralizing concentrations of IgG 1A5. A significant increase of DENV-4 viremia titers (up to 100-fold) was also demonstrated in juvenile rhesus monkeys immunized with passively transferred dilutions of IgG 1A5. These results, together with earlier findings of ADE of DENV-2 infection by a polyclonal serum, establish the primate model for analysis of ADE. Considering the abundance of these cross-reactive antibodies, our observations confirm that significant viral amplification could occur during DENV infections in humans with prior infection or with maternally transferred immunity, possibly leading to severe dengue. Strategies to eliminate ADE were explored by altering the antibody Fc structures responsible for binding to Fc receptors. IgG 1A5 variants, containing amino acid substitutions from the Fc region of IgG2 or IgG4 antibodies, reduced but did not eliminate DENV-4-enhancing activity in K562 cells. Importantly, a 9-aa deletion at the N terminus of the CH(2) domain in the Fc region abrogated the enhancing activity.},

  abstract = {Vibriocholerae, which is autochthonous to estuaries worldwide, can cause human cholera that is still pandemic in developing countries. A number of V. cholerae isolates of clinical and environmental origin worldwide have been subjected to genome sequencing to address their phylogenesis and bacterial pathogenesis, however, little genome information is available for V. cholerae isolates derived from estuaries, particularly in China. In this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of V. cholerae CHN108B (non-O1/O139 serogroup) isolated from the Yangtze River Estuary, China and performed comparative genome analysis between CHN108B and other eight representative V. cholerae isolates. The 4,168,545-bp V. cholerae CHN108B genome (47.2\% G+C) consists of two circular chromosomes with 3,691 predicted protein-encoding genes. It has 110 strain-specific genes, the highest number among the eight representative V. cholerae whole genomes from serogroup O1: there are seven clinical isolates linked to cholera pandemics (1937–2010) and one environmental isolate from Brazil. Various mobile genetic elements (such as insertion sequences, prophages, integrative and conjugative elements, and super-integrons) were identified in the nine V. cholerae genomes of clinical and environmental origin, indicating that the bacterium undergoes extensive genetic recombination via lateral gene transfer. Comparative genomics also revealed different virulence and antimicrobial resistance gene patterns among the V. cholerae isolates, suggesting some potential virulence factors and the rising development of resistance among pathogenic V. cholerae. Additionally, draft genome sequences of multiple V. cholerae isolates recovered from the Yangtze River Estuary were also determined, and comparative genomics revealed many genes involved in specific metabolism pathways, which are likely shaped by the unique estuary environment. These results provide additional evidence of V. cholerae genome plasticity and will facilitate better understanding of the genome evolution and pathogenesis of this severe water-borne pathogen worldwide.},

In this review, we outline the mechanisms of ADE, as ascertained in vitro. We also discuss several recent human and non-human primate studies that raise concern about ADE resulting from vaccine-induced or passively infused antibodies. Although biologically plausible, an important role for ADE in natural HIV infection has not been directly confirmed. Nonetheless, there is a need for further studies to pinpoint the exact mechanism or mechanisms at play in vivo and, more importantly, to develop assays that can predict the likelihood that a vaccine or antibody infusion will lead to enhanced infection or pathogenesis.},

To determine whether phenotypic changes in dengue antibodies occur over time, we analyzed serum samples collected 4-8 and 20-22 years after DENV-1 infection. We found a significant increase in mean titer of homologous DENV-1 neutralizing antibodies and a significant decrease in heterologous antibodies to 1 of 2 genotypes of DENV-2 virus (the American genotype). Asian DENV-2 viruses were not neutralized during either interval; however, the American genotype underwent phenotypic changes in heterotypic viral neutralizing antibodies in the predicted direction. This finding may be related to the time-dependent changes in severity of disease found with secondary dengue infection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A candidate tetravalent dengue vaccine is being assessed in three clinical trials involving more than 35,000 children between the ages of 2 and 16 years in Asian-Pacific and Latin American countries. We report the results of long-term follow-up interim analyses and integrated efficacy analyses. METHODS We are assessing the incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue as a surrogate safety end point during follow-up in years 3 to 6 of two phase 3 trials, CYD14 and CYD15, and a phase 2b trial, CYD23/57. We estimated vaccine efficacy using pooled data from the first 25 months of CYD14 and CYD15. RESULTS Follow-up data were available for 10,165 of 10,275 participants (99\%) in CYD14 and 19,898 of 20,869 participants (95\%) in CYD15. Data were available for 3203 of the 4002 participants (80\%) in the CYD23 trial included in CYD57. During year 3 in the CYD14, CYD15, and CYD57 trials combined, hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue occurred in 65 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 39 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled relative risks of hospitalization for dengue were 0.84 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.24) among all participants, 1.58 (95\% CI, 0.83 to 3.02) among those under the age of 9 years, and 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) among those 9 years of age or older. During year 3, hospitalization for severe dengue, as defined by the independent data monitoring committee criteria, occurred in 18 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 6 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled rates of efficacy for symptomatic dengue during the first 25 months were 60.3\% (95\% CI, 55.7 to 64.5) for all participants, 65.6\% (95\% CI, 60.7 to 69.9) for those 9 years of age or older, and 44.6\% (95\% CI, 31.6 to 55.0) for those younger than 9 years of age. CONCLUSIONS Although the unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue in year 3 among children younger than 9 years of age needs to be carefully monitored during long-term follow-up, the risk among children 2 to 16 years of age was lower in the vaccine group than in the control group.

Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted according to World Health Organization guidelines with nontypeable isolates further analyzed by molecular serotyping. A national invasive disease surveillance program was conducted throughout the corresponding period., Pneumococcus was isolated from 47\% of children, 9\% of parents, and 2.2\% of older adults. For these groups, the percentage of serotypes covered by PCV7 were 1.5\%, 0.0\%, and 15.4\%, with a further 20.1\%, 44.4\%, and 7.7\% coverage added by those in PCV13. In each group, the percentage of disease due to serotypes covered by PCV7 were 1.0\%, 7.4\% and 5.1\% with a further 65.3\%, 42.1\%, and 61.4\% attributed to those in PCV13., The prevalence of carriage is the highest in children, with direct vaccine impact exemplified by low carriage and disease prevalence of PCV7 serotypes in vaccinated children, whereas the indirect effects of herd protection are implied by similar observations in unvaccinated parents and older adults.},

We used a population genetic approach to test first whether the selective impact of vaccination could be detected in a longitudinal carriage sample, and secondly how long it persisted for following introduction of vaccine in 2000. To detect the selective impact of the vaccine we compared the serotype diversity of samples from pneumococcal carriage in Massachusetts children collected in 2001, 2004, and 2007 with others collected in the pre-vaccine era in Massachusetts, the UK, and Finland. The 2004 sample was significantly (p{$>$}0.0001) more diverse than pre-vaccine samples, indicating the selective pressure of vaccination. The 2007 sample showed no significant difference in diversity from the pre-vaccine period and exhibited similar population structure, but with different serotypes. In 2007 the carriage frequency of 19A was similar to that of the most common serotype in pre-vaccine samples. We suggest that serotype replacement involving 19A may be complete in Massachusetts due to similarities in population structure to pre-vaccine samples. These results suggest that the replacement phenomenon occurs rapidly with high vaccine coverage and may allay concerns about future increases in disease due to 19A. For other serotypes, the future course of replacement disease remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been reduced in the US following conjugate vaccination (PCV7) targeting seven pneumococcal serotypes in 2000. However, increases in IPD due to other serotypes have been observed, in particular 19A. How much this “serotype replacement” will erode the benefits of vaccination and over what timescale is unknown. We used a population genetic approach to test first whether the selective impact of vaccination could be detected in a longitudinal carriage sample, and secondly how long it persisted for following introduction of vaccine in 2000. To detect the selective impact of the vaccine we compared the serotype diversity of samples from pneumococcal carriage in Massachusetts children collected in 2001, 2004, and 2007 with others collected in the pre-vaccine era in Massachusetts, the UK, and Finland. The 2004 sample was significantly (p{$>$}0.0001) more diverse than pre-vaccine samples, indicating the selective pressure of vaccination.

ARID1A is a core component of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, which is one of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. To uncover the role of ARID1A in hematopoietic development, we utilized hematopoietic cell-specific deletion of Arid1a in mice. We demonstrate that ARID1A is essential for maintaining the frequency and function of hematopoietic stem cells and its loss impairs the differentiation of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. ARID1A deficiency led to a global reduction in open chromatin and ensuing transcriptional changes affected key genes involved in hematopoietic development. We also observed that silencing of ARID1A affected ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells, suggesting its role in granulocytic differentiation of human leukemic cells. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive elucidation of the function of ARID1A in hematopoiesis and highlights the central role of ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex in maintaining chromatin dynamics in hematopoietic cells.},

METHODS All psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients, fulfilling CASPAR criteria, with an average disease duration of \textbackslash textgreater10 years were invited for detailed clinical evaluation. The total lag time from symptom onset to their first rheumatological encounter was studied. The data were extracted from the referral letters and medical records. Patients were classified as early consulters or late consulters depending on whether they were seen by a rheumatologist within or beyond 6 months of symptom onset. RESULTS 283 PsA patients were studied. Median lag time from the disease onset to the first rheumatological assessment of the cohort was 1.00 years (IQR 0.5-2). 30\% (n=86), 53\% (n=149) and 71\% (n=202) of the cohort were seen by a rheumatologist within 6 months, 1 and 2 years of symptom onset, respectively. PsA patients with low education status (OR 2.09, p=0.02) and Body Mass Index (OR 0.92, p=0.01) were significantly more likely to have a diagnostic delay of \textbackslash textgreater2 years. On multiple stepwise regression analysis, the model predicted significant association of late consulters with the development of peripheral joint erosions (OR 4.25, p=0.001) and worse Health Assessment Questionnaire scores (OR 2.2, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Even a 6-month delay from symptom onset to the first visit with a rheumatologist contributes to the development of peripheral joint erosions and worse long-term physical function.},

METHODS Patients were divided into two groups: Group-1, consecutive psoriasis patients attending dermatology clinics with no known diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis and Group-2, consecutive patients attending rheumatology clinics with a confirmed diagnosis of PsA. In Group-1, patients completed the screening questionnaires, followed by a full rheumatological evaluation whether or not they reported musculoskeletal symptoms. RESULTS 200 patients were recruited with 100 in each group. In all, 84\% of patients in dermatology group were using systemic therapy for their skin disease, and 99\% of patients in rheumatology group were on systemic immunosuppressives. In Group-1, 29\% of patients were diagnosed with PsA after rheumatological evaluation. On univariate and multivariate analyses, there was a significant positive association between Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and a new diagnosis of PsA (p=0.046). Different patterns of joint involvement were noted in patients with newly diagnosed PsA versus patients with established PsA with fewer polyarticular disease presentations (p=0.0001). In Group-1, the PEST, PASE and ToPAS assessments had sensitivities of 27.5\%, 24\% and 41\%, and specificities of 98\%, 94\% and 90\%, respectively. In Group-2, the sensitivities were 86\%, 62\% and 83\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS 29\% of Ps patients attending dermatology clinics had undiagnosed PsA. Psoriasis severity was associated with a new diagnosis of PsA. Poor sensitivities for the screening questionnaires were noted due to inadequate detection of patterns of arthritis other than polyarticular disease.},

Previous analyses of epidemiological datasets suggested the short-term vaccine-associated dynamics of \emph{S. pneumoniae} strains may be mediated through multi-locus negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), acting to maintain accessory loci at equilibrium frequencies. To test whether this model could explain how such multi-strain populations were generated, it was modified to incorporate recombination. The outputs of simulations featuring symmetrical recombination were compared with genomic data on locus frequencies and distributions between genotypes, pairwise genetic distances and tree shape. These demonstrated NFDS prevented the loss of variation through neutral drift, but generated unstructured populations of diverse isolates. Making recombination asymmetrical, favouring deletion of accessory loci over insertion, alongside multi-locus NFDS significantly improved the fit to genomic data. In a population at equilibrium, structuring into multiple strains was stable due to outbreeding depression, resulting from recombinants with reduced accessory genomes having lower fitness than their parental genotypes. As many bacteria inhibit the integration of insertions into their chromosomes, this combination of asymmetrical recombination and multi-locus NFDS may underlie the co-existence of strains within a single ecological niche.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Increased colonization capacity and transformability are, however, intriguing features of these pneumococci and play an important role. Twenty-seven nonencapsulated pneumococci were identified in a nationwide collection of 1,980 nasopharyngeal samples and 215 blood samples obtained between 1998 and 2002. On the basis of multilocus sequence typing and capsule region analysis we divided the nonencapsulated pneumococci into two groups. Group I was closely related to encapsulated strains. Group II had a clonal population structure, including two geographically widespread clones able to cause epidemic conjunctivitis and invasive diseases. Group II strains also carried a 1,959-bp homologue of aliB (aliB-like ORF 2) in the capsule region, which was highly homologous to a sequence in the capsule region of Streptococcus mitis. In addition, strains of the two major clones in group II had an additional sequence, aliB-like ORF 1 (1,968 to 2,004 bp), upstream of aliB-like ORF 2. Expression of aliB-like ORF 1 was detected by reverse transcription-PCR, and the corresponding RNA was visualized by Northern blotting. A gene fragment homologous to capN of serotypes 33 and 37 suggests that group II strains were derived from encapsulated pneumococci some time ago. Therefore, loss of capsule expression in vivo was found to be associated with the importation of one or two aliB homologues in some nonencapsulated pneumococci.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming an important part of epidemiological investigations of infectious diseases due to greater resolution and cost reductions compared to traditional typing approaches. Many public health and clinical teams will increasingly use WGS to investigate clusters of potential pathogen transmission, making it crucial to understand the benefits and assumptions of the analytical methods for investigating the data. We aimed to understand how different approaches affect inferences of transmission dynamics and outline limitations of the methods. METHODS We comprehensively searched electronic databases for studies that presented methods used to interpret WGS data for investigating tuberculosis (TB) transmission. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Due to considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies, we present summary data with accompanying narrative synthesis rather than pooled analyses. RESULTS Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. Despite the range of interpretation tools, the usefulness of WGS data in understanding TB transmission often depends on the amount of genetic diversity in the setting. Where diversity is small, distinguishing re-infections from relapses may be impossible; interpretation may be aided by the use of epidemiological data, examining minor variants and deep sequencing. Conversely, when within-host diversity is large, due to genetic hitchhiking or co-infection of two dissimilar strains, it is critical to understand how it arose. Greater understanding of microevolution and mixed infection will enhance interpretation of WGS data. CONCLUSIONS As sequencing studies have sampled more intensely and integrated multiple sources of information, the understanding of TB transmission and diversity has grown, but there is still much to be learnt about the origins of diversity that will affect inferences from these data. Public health teams and researchers should combine epidemiological, clinical and WGS data to strengthen investigations of transmission.},

We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to four autosomal contiguous human–chimp–gorilla–orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We find a very recent speciation time of human–chimp (4.1 ± 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective population sizes (65,000 ± 30,000 for the human–chimp ancestor and 45,000 ± 10,000 for the human–chimp–gorilla ancestor). Furthermore, around 50\% of the human genome coalesces with chimpanzee after speciation with gorilla. We also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than 75\% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different genealogies correlates well with the region-wide present-day human recombination rate, but does not correlate with the fine-scale recombination rates and recombination hot spots, suggesting that the latter are evolutionarily transient.},

Consecutive samples were collected from buccal and pharyngeal mucosal surfaces of two infants, their four parents, and two elderly individuals over a period of approximately 1 year. A total of 751 isolates identified as S. mitisbiovar 1 were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and representative clones were typed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). The genetic diversity of the S. mitis biovar 1 isolates collected from single infant hosts over a period of 9 to 10 months was found to be between 0.69 and 0.76, which is considerably higher than that previously observed for intestinal populations ofEscherichia coli. The study provides evidence of the existence of both transient and persistent clones in adult individuals. In the two infants, however, none of 42 demonstrated clones were detected on more than a single occasion. Statistical calculations showed that the ability to persist was not distributed at random in theS. mitis biovar 1 population. However, neither immunoglobulin A1 protease activity nor the ability to bind α-amylase from saliva was a preferential characteristic of persistent genotypes. In contrast to current concepts of climax ecosystems, the species niche in the habitat appears to be maintained predominantly by a succession of clones rather than by stable strains. Several lines of evidence suggest that the major origin of “new” clones is the many other habitats in the respiratory tract that are occupied by this species.},

A prospective study was conducted to collect invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae from children for genetic analysis from January 2004 to December 2006 in Taiwan. PCRs were performed to detect the zmpC and zmpD genes, both encoding a metalloprotease virulence factor in pneumococci, among these invasive isolates. During the study period, 68 invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae were obtained for analysis. Serotype 14 was the most common type isolated from children with invasive disease and was significantly associated with pneumonia (OR 3.1; 95\% CI] 1.1–8.8; p 0.035). Serotype 23F was significantly associated with bacteraemia (OR 7.5; 95\% CI 1.8–31.3; p 0.006).

However, owing to technical complexity and lack of available tools, most pedigree-based sequencing studies rely on an ad hoc combination of suboptimal analyses. Here we present pedigree-VAAST (pVAAST), a disease-gene identification tool designed for high-throughput sequence data in pedigrees. pVAAST uses a sequence-based model to perform variant and gene-based linkage analysis. Linkage information is then combined with functional prediction and rare variant case-control association information in a unified statistical framework. pVAAST outperformed linkage and rare-variant association tests in simulations and identified disease-causing genes from whole-genome sequence data in three human pedigrees with dominant, recessive and de novo inheritance patterns. The approach is robust to incomplete penetrance and locus heterogeneity and is applicable to a wide variety of genetic traits. pVAAST maintains high power across studies of monogenic, high-penetrance phenotypes in a single pedigree to highly polygenic, common phenotypes involving hundreds of pedigrees.},

  abstract = {The Streptococcuspneumoniae capsule is vital for virulence and may inhibit complement activity and phagocytosis. However, there are only limited data on the mechanisms by which the capsule affects complement and the consequences for S. pneumoniae interactions with phagocytes. Using unencapsulated serotype 2 and 4 S. pneumoniae mutants, we have confirmed that the capsule has several effects on complement activity. The capsule impaired bacterial opsonization with C3b/iC3b by both the alternative and classical complement pathways and also inhibited conversion of C3b bound to the bacterial surface to iC3b. There was increased binding of the classical pathway mediators immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to unencapsulated S. pneumoniae, indicating that the capsule could inhibit classical pathway complement activity by masking antibody recognition of subcapsular antigens, as well as by inhibiting CRP binding. Cleavage of serum IgG by the enzyme IdeS reduced C3b/iC3b deposition on all of the strains, but there were still marked increases in C3b/iC3b deposition on unencapsulated TIGR4 and D39 strains compared to encapsulated strains, suggesting that the capsule inhibits both IgG-mediated and IgG-independent complement activity against S. pneumoniae. Unencapsulated strains were more susceptible to neutrophil phagocytosis after incubation in normal serum, normal serum treated with IdeS, complement-deficient serum, and complement-deficient serum treated with IdeS or in buffer alone, suggesting that the capsule inhibits phagocytosis mediated by Fcγ receptors, complement receptors, and nonopsonic receptors. Overall, these data show that the S. pneumoniae capsule affects multiple aspects of complement- and neutrophil-mediated immunity, resulting in a profound inhibition of opsonophagocytosis.},

All microbiology laboratories in Cambodia were contacted for identification of stored isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from clinical specimens taken before the introduction of PCV13. Available isolates were serotyped using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. Among 166 identified isolates available for serotyping from patients with pneumococcal disease, 4\% were isolated from upper respiratory samples and 80\% were from lower respiratory samples, and 16\% were invasive isolates. PCV13 serotypes accounted for 60\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 52-67) of all isolates; 56\% (95\% CI 48-64) of noninvasive and 77\% (95\% CI 57-89) of invasive isolates. Antibiotic resistance was more common among PCV13 serotypes. This study of clinical S. pneumoniae isolates supports the potential for high reduction in pneumococcal disease burden and may serve as baseline data for future monitoring of S. pneumoniae serotypes circulation after implementation of PCV13 childhood vaccination in Cambodia.},

We posit that the increasing availability of bacterial genomes and epidemiological data means that the field is now ripe to lay the foundations for applying phylodynamics to bacterial pathogens. The development of new methods that integrate more complex genomic and ecological data will help to inform public heath surveillance and control strategies for bacterial pathogens that represent serious threats to human health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the accuracy and characteristics of different questionnaire-based PsA screening tools. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, Excerpta Medical Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies that evaluated the accuracy of self-administered PsA screening tools for patients with psoriasis. A bivariate meta-analysis was used to pool screening tool-specific accuracy estimates (sensitivity and specificity). Heterogeneity of the diagnostic odds ratio was evaluated through meta-regression. All full-text records were assessed for risk of bias with the QUADAS 2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 2280 references were identified and 130 records were assessed for full-text review, of which 42 were included for synthesis. Of these, 27 were included in quantitative syntheses. Of the records, 37\% had an overall low risk of bias. Fourteen different screening tools and 104 separate accuracy estimates were identified. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated for the Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation (cut-off = 44), Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation (47), Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screening (8), Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (3) and Early Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Questionnaire (3). The Early Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Questionnaire reported the highest sensitivity and specificity (0.85 each). The I2 for the diagnostic odds ratios varied between 76 and 90.1\%. Meta-regressions were conducted, in which the age, risk of bias for patient selection and the screening tool accounted for some of the observed heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire-based tools have moderate accuracy to identify PsA among psoriasis patients. The Early Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Questionnaire appears to have slightly better accuracy compared with the Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screening, Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool and Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation. An economic evaluation could model the uncertainty and estimate the cost-effectiveness of PsA screening programs that use different tools.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Psoriatic plaques have been shown to contain increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-8, and interferon (IFN)-gamma have been reported elevated in psoriatic patients. AIM To evaluate serum cytokine profiles in psoriasis patients by improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique and to correlate these levels with disease severity. METHODS We analyzed single serum samples from 10 patients with active untreated psoriasis, two patients with active treated psoriasis, and five healthy volunteers for major T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 cytokines using the LINCOplex ELISA multi-analyte detection system that permits simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines from a single sample. The disease severity, including erythema, induration, scale, and surface area, was assessed. RESULTS IFN-gamma was markedly elevated in all sera from psoriasis patients, 33.8 +/- 1.3 pg/ml (mean +/- standard error) versus 8 +/- 1.5 pg/ml for normal controls (p \textbackslash textless 0.01), and positively correlated with all indices of disease severity (Spearman r \textbackslash textgreater 0.6). IL-8 was also increased in psoriasis patients (24.4 +/- 1.8 pg/ml) versus normal controls (3.6 +/- 1.2 pg/ml) (p \textbackslash textless 0.05) and positively correlated with the degree of erythema (Spearman r \textbackslash textgreater 0.6). Mean IL-12 levels were decreased in sera from psoriasis patients (8.5 +/- 1.2 pg/ml) compared with normal controls (42.2 +/- 5.3 pg/ml) (p \textbackslash textless 0.01). Also, serum IL-10 levels were below detection levels in psoriatics compared with controls (6.4 +/- 1.3 pg/ml). CONCLUSIONS This new ELISA system allowed rapid and reliable detection of numerous cytokines in single serum samples from patients with psoriasis. We observed that IFN-gamma and IL-8 cytokines were elevated in psoriatics and correlated with parameters of disease severity while IL-10 and IL-12 were decreased.},

  abstract = {In silico tools have been developed to predict variants that may have an impact on pre-mRNA splicing. The major limitation of the application of these tools to basic research and clinical practice is the difficulty in interpreting the output. Most tools only predict potential splice sites given a DNA sequence without measuring splicing signal changes caused by a variant. Another limitation is the lack of large-scale evaluation studies of these tools. We compared eight in silico tools on 2959 single nucleotide variants within splicing consensus regions (scSNVs) using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The Position Weight Matrix model and MaxEntScan outperformed other methods. Two ensemble learning methods, adaptive boosting and random forests, were used to construct models that take advantage of individual methods. Both models further improved prediction, with outputs of directly interpretable prediction scores. We applied our ensemble scores to scSNVs from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. Analysis showed that predicted splice-altering scSNVs are enriched in recurrent scSNVs and known cancer genes. We pre-computed our ensemble scores for all potential scSNVs across the human genome, providing a whole genome level resource for identifying splice-altering scSNVs discovered from large-scale sequencing studies.},

  abstract = {Koebner phenomenon refers to the emergence of new psoriatic lesions in the healthy skin regions following an injury/trauma to psoriatic patients. The occurrence of psoriatic lesions at unusual areas of the body regions such as on penis, around eyes and on keloids suggest that the Koebner phenomenon may be responsible for these lesions. A number of agents/triggers have been reported to induce the development of new psoriatic lesions in healthy skin areas and these include, tattooing skin, radiations, skin incision, viral infections and striae etc. The different mechanisms that contribute in inducing the development of new psoriatic lesions as Koebernization include the involvement of mast cell-derived inflammatory mediators such as tryptase, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-36γ. Moreover, an increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also contribute in Koebernization. Apart from these, there is a critical role of α 2 β1 integrins, S100A7 (psoriasin) and S100A15 (koebnerisin), change in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, down-regulation of mechanosensitive polycystin 1 protein, decrease in inflammation controlling atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2), reduced expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) on the keratinocytes and increase in levels of chemokines (CXCL8 and CCL20) in inducing formation of new psoriatic lesions. The present review discusses the role of Koebner phenomenon in the development of new psoriatic lesions. Moreover, it also describes the mechanisms involved in Koebernization in the form of discussion of different key targets that may be potentially modulated pharmacologically to attenuate/halt the development of new psoriatic lesions.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli associated with urinary tract infections and bacteremia has been intensively investigated, including recent work focusing on the virulent, globally disseminated, multidrug-resistant lineage ST131. To contextualize ST131 within the broader E. coli population associated with disease, we used genomics to analyze a systematic 11-yr hospital-based survey of E. coli associated with bacteremia using isolates collected from across England by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and from the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Population dynamics analysis of the most successful lineages identified the emergence of ST131 and ST69 and their establishment as two of the five most common lineages along with ST73, ST95, and ST12. The most frequently identified lineage was ST73. Compared to ST131, ST73 was susceptible to most antibiotics, indicating that multidrug resistance was not the dominant reason for prevalence of E. coli lineages in this population. Temporal phylogenetic analysis of the emergence of ST69 and ST131 identified differences in the dynamics of emergence and showed that expansion of ST131 in this population was not driven by sequential emergence of increasingly resistant subclades. We showed that over time, the E. coli population was only transiently disturbed by the introduction of new lineages before a new equilibrium was rapidly achieved. Together, these findings suggest that the frequency of E. coli lineages in invasive disease is driven by negative frequency-dependent selection occurring outside of the hospital, most probably in the commensal niche, and that drug resistance is not a primary determinant of success in this niche.},

An accurate phylogenetic tree underpins our understanding of the major transitions in evolution, such as the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, and is key to inferring the origin of new genes, detecting molecular adaptation, understanding morphological character evolution and reconstructing demographic changes in recently diverged species. Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies.

Analysing the results of simulations also presents a substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more quickly than with existing methods.},

  abstract = {While significant protection from pneumococcal disease has been achieved by the use of polysaccharide and polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines, capsule-independent protection has been limited by serotype replacement along with disease caused by nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp). NESp strains compose approximately 3\% to 19\% of asymptomatic carriage isolates and harbor multiple antibiotic resistance genes. Surface proteins unique to NESp enhance colonization and virulence despite the lack of a capsule even though the capsule has been thought to be required for pneumococcal pathogenesis. Genes for pneumococcal surface proteins replace the capsular polysaccharide (cps) locus in some NESp isolates, and these proteins aid in pneumococcal colonization and otitis media (OM). NESp strains have been isolated from patients with invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal disease, but noninvasive diseases, specifically, conjunctivitis (85\%) and OM (8\%), are of higher prevalence. Conjunctival strains are commonly of the so-called classical NESp lineages defined by multilocus sequence types (STs) ST344 and ST448, while sporadic NESp lineages such as ST1106 are more commonly isolated from patients with other diseases. Interestingly, sporadic lineages have significantly higher rates of recombination than classical lineages. Higher rates of recombination can lead to increased acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, increasing the risk of disease and hindering treatment. NESp strains are a significant proportion of the pneumococcal population, can cause disease, and may be increasing in prevalence in the population due to effects on the pneumococcal niche caused by pneumococcal vaccines. Current vaccines are ineffective against NESp, and further research is necessary to develop vaccines effective against both encapsulated and nonencapsulated pneumococci.},

However, the functional relationship between these homologs has not been explored. Here, we use ATAC-seq, genome-wide histone modification mapping, and expression analysis to examine colorectal cancer cells lacking one or both ARID proteins. We find that ARID1A has a dominant role in maintaining chromatin accessibility at enhancers, while the contribution of ARID1B is evident only in the context of ARID1A mutation. Changes in accessibility are predictive of changes in expression and correlate with loss of H3K4me and H3K27ac marks, nucleosome spacing, and transcription factor binding, particularly at growth pathway genes including MET. We find that ARID1B knockdown in ARID1A mutant ovarian cancer cells causes similar loss of enhancer architecture, suggesting that this is a conserved function underlying the synthetic lethality between ARID1A and ARID1B.},

A total of 23 MDR, pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. The results showed that the MDR, pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis strains mainly belonged to the Haarlem 3 genotype (11/23; 47.8\%), followed by the Beijing family (9/23; 39.1\%). In addition, the 23 strains were clustered into 21 genotypes using a 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. In conclusion, Haarlem 3 genotype was the predominant genotype among the isolates from MDR-TB cases in this study, which could be of special concern.}

  abstract = {IgA1 protease activity, which allows bacteria to cleave human IgA1 in the hinge region, represents a striking example of convergent evolution of a specific property in bacteria. Although it has been known since 1979 that IgA1 protease is produced by the three leading causes of bacterial meningitis in addition to important urogenital pathogens and some members of the oropharyngeal flora, the exact role of this enzyme in bacterial pathogenesis is still incompletely understood owing to lack of a satisfactory animal model. Cleavage of IgA1 by these post-proline endopeptidases efficiently separates the monomeric antigen-binding fragments from the secondary effector functions of the IgA1 antibody molecule. Several in vivo and in vitro observations indicate that the enzymes are important for the ability of bacteria to colonize mucosal membranes in the presence of S-IgA antibodies. Furthermore, the extensive cleavage of IgA sometimes observed in vivo, suggests that IgA1 protease activity results in a local functional IgA deficiency that may facilitate colonization of other microorganisms and the penetration of potential allergens. It has been hypothesized that IgA1 protease activity of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, under special immunological circumstances, allows these bacteria to take advantage of specific IgA1 antibodies in a strategy to evade other immune factors of the human body. The decisive factor is the balance between IgA antibodies against surface antigens of the respective bacteria and their IgA1 protease. Recent studies have shown that serine-type IgA1 proteases of H. influenzae, meningococci, and gonococci belong to a family of proteins used by a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria for colonization and invasion.},

While other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, S. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. Population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that S. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus infantis. The remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as Streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. Virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding IgA1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among S. mitis lineages. Estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. During their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in their respective hosts.},

Successful adaptation of S. mitis and other commensal streptococci to a harmonious relationship with the host relied on genetic stability and properties facilitating life in biofilms., From a common ancestor, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis evolved in parallel into one of the most important pathogens and a mutualistic colonizer of humans, respectively. This evolutionary scenario provides a unique basis for studies of both infection-associated properties and properties important for harmonious coexistence with the host. We performed detailed comparisons of 60 genomes of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, the three Streptococcus oralis subspecies oralis, tigurinus, and dentisani, and Streptococcus infantis. Nonfunctional remnants of ancestral genes in both S. pneumoniae and in S. mitis support the evolutionary model and the concept that evolutionary changes on both sides were required to reach their present relationship to the host. Confirmed by screening of {$>$}7,500 genomes, we identified 224 genes associated with virulence. The striking difference to commensal streptococci was the diversity of regulatory mechanisms, including regulation of capsule production, a significantly larger arsenal of enzymes involved in carbohydrate hydrolysis, and proteins known to interfere with innate immune factors. The exclusive presence of the virulence factors in S. pneumoniae enhances their potential as vaccine components, as a direct impact on beneficial members of the commensal microbiota can be excluded. In addition to loss of these virulence-associated genes, adaptation of S. mitis to a mutualistic relationship with the host apparently required preservation or acquisition of 25 genes lost or absent from S. pneumoniae. Successful adaptation of S. mitis and other commensal streptococci to a harmonious relationship with the host relied on genetic stability and properties facilitating life in biofilms.},

  abstract = {The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. Intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal Streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. In a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15\%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from S. mitis to S. pneumoniae. Import of genes from S. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae. Our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. While genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. IMPORTANCE One of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal Streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. Faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. We have shown that the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports genes from S. mitis and other related streptococci. This process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.},

  abstract = {Background Since 1971, Kenya has had repeated cholera outbreaks. However, the cause of seasonal epidemics of cholera is not fully understood and neither are the factors that drive epidemics, both in Kenya and globally. Objectives The objectives of the study were to determine the environmental reservoirs of V. cholerae during an interepidemic period in Kenya and to characterise their virulence factors. Methods One hundred (50 clinical, 50 environmental) samples were tested for V. cholerae isolates using both simplex and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results Both sediments and algae from fishing and landing bays yielded isolates of V. cholerae. Clinical strains were characterised along with the environmental strains for comparison. All clinical strains harboured ctxA, tcpA (El Tor), ompU, zot, ace, toxR, hylA (El Tor) and tcpI genes. Prevalence for virulence genes in environmental strains was hylA (El Tor) (10\%), toxR (24\%), zot (22\%), ctxA (12\%), tcpI (8\%), hylA (26\%) and tcpA (12\%). Conclusion The study sites, including landing bays and beaches, contained environmental V. cholerae, suggesting that these may be reservoirs for frequent epidemics. Improved hygiene and fish-handling techniques will be important in reducing the persistence of reservoirs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To provide primary care clinicians with an up-to-date and practical overview of the diagnosis and management of psoriasis. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and observational studies about the diagnosis and management of psoriasis. MAIN MESSAGE Psoriasis is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disease with predominantly skin and joint involvement. Beyond the physical dimensions of disease, psoriasis has an extensive emotional and psychosocial effect on patients, affecting social functioning and interpersonal relationships. As a disease of systemic inflammation, psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and malignancy. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and a skin biopsy is seldom required. Depending on the severity of disease, appropriate treatment can be initiated. For mild to moderate disease, first-line treatment involves topical therapies including corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues, and combination products. These topical treatments are efficacious and can be safely initiated and prescribed by primary care physicians. Patients with more severe and refractory symptoms might require further evaluation by a dermatologist for systemic therapy. CONCLUSION Many patients with psoriasis seek initial evaluation and treatment from their primary care providers. Recognition of psoriasis, as well as its associated medical and psychiatric comorbidities, would facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate management with effective and safe topical therapies and other medical and psychological interventions, as needed. More severe and refractory cases might warrant referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation and possible systemic therapy.},

Analysis of molecular-based data showed diverse genetic backgrounds among drug-sensitive and MDR TB sensu stricto isolates in contrast to restricted genetic backgrounds among pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR TB isolates. Second-line drug resistance was significantly associated with the atypical Beijing genotype. DNA fingerprinting and sequencing demonstrated that the pre-XDR and XDR atypical Beijing isolates evolved from a common progenitor; 85\% and 92\%, respectively, were clustered, indicating transmission. Ninety-three percent of atypical XDR Beijing isolates had mutations that confer resistance to 10 anti-TB drugs, and some isolates also were resistant to para-aminosalicylic acid. These findings suggest the emergence of totally drug-resistant TB.},

In most patients with PsA, pharmacologic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and biologic agents is effective. However, when pharmacological treatment fails, patients with PsA may benefit from orthopedic surgery, which can improve both joint function and quality of life. Total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and arthroscopic synovectomy of the knee are the most common surgical procedures offered to patients with PsA. The management of PsA requires the care of a multidisciplinary team, which should include dermatologists, rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and orthopedic surgeons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involves inflammation, activation of platelets, coagulation and changes in fibrinolysis as well as remodelling of myocardial tissue after STEMI. Recently, new proximity extension assays including panels of biomarkers for cardiovascular disease have been developed. This study investigates a wide range of cardiovascular protein biomarkers in the acute phase of STEMI compared with the stable phase three months after STEMI. We hypothesized that major changes in inflammation, haemostasis, tissue remodelling, and proteolysis are prevalent. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, observational study including 48 STEMI patients (mean age 60 ± 12 years, 79\% men) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Blood samples were obtained immediately prior to PPCI and again three months later. Levels of 92 biomarkers reflecting inflammation, immune response, cell adhesion, haemostasis, fibrinolysis, tissue remodelling, and proteolysis were assessed using a proximity extension assay (Olink® CARDIOVASCULAR III). RESULTS When comparing the acute phase of STEMI with the stable phase three months later, a total of 29 biomarkers differed significantly after Bonferroni correction (p \textbackslash textless 0.0005). In the acute phase of STEMI, we found an overall increase of biomarkers reflecting immune and inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and haemostasis. Biomarkers reflecting tissue remodelling and proteolysis were increased at three months follow-up compared with the acute phase. Out of the 29 biomarkers, six biomarkers did not confirm our predefined hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS Using a novel proximity extension assay technique, we detected changes in several biomarkers when comparing the acute phase with three months follow-up in patients with STEMI. These biomarkers may play important roles in the pathogenesis of STEMI.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have linked demographic changes and epidemiological patterns in bacterial populations using coalescent-based approaches. We identified 26 studies using skyline plots and found that 21 inferred overall population expansion. This surprising result led us to analyze the impact of natural selection, recombination (gene conversion), and sampling biases on demographic inference using skyline plots and site frequency spectra (SFS). Forward simulations based on biologically relevant parameters from Escherichia coli populations showed that theoretical arguments on the detrimental impact of recombination and especially natural selection on the reconstructed genealogies cannot be ignored in practice. In fact, both processes systematically lead to spurious interpretations of population expansion in skyline plots (and in SFS for selection). Weak purifying selection, and especially positive selection, had important effects on skyline plots, showing patterns akin to those of population expansions. State-of-the-art techniques to remove recombination further amplified these biases. We simulated three common sampling biases in microbiological research: uniform, clustered, and mixed sampling. Alone, or together with recombination and selection, they further mislead demographic inferences producing almost any possible skyline shape or SFS. Interestingly, sampling sub-populations also affected skyline plots and SFS, because the  coalescent rates of populations and their sub-populations had different distributions. This study suggests that extreme caution is needed to infer demographic changes solely based on reconstructed genealogies. We suggest that the development of novel sampling strategies and the joint analyzes of diverse population genetic methods are strictly necessary to estimate demographic changes in populations where selection, recombination, and biased sampling are  present.},

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of cotransferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene coevolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighboring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of cofunctioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The availability of bacterial pangenome data grows exponentially, requiring efficient new methods of analysis. Currently popular approaches for the fast comparison of genomes have the drawback of not being based on explicit evolutionary models of diversification. Making sense of bacterial genome evolution, and notably in the accessory genome, requires however to take into account the complex processes by which the genomes evolve. Here we present the Pantagruel bioinformatic software pipeline, which enables the construction of a complete bacterial pangenome database geared towards the inference of gene evolution scenarios using gene tree/species tree reconciliation. Pantagruel is a modular pipeline that combines state-of-the-art external software with unique new methods. It can be executed with no supervision to perform a standard pangenome analysis, or be configured by advanced users to integrate methods of choice. A relational database underlies its data structure, allowing efficient retrieval of the large-scale data generated by integrative analyses of pangenome evolutionary history. From the reconstructed gene evolution scenarios, two main outputs are derived: firstly the gene tree-aware assignation of orthology, allowing the fine analysis of gene gain and loss history over the species phylogeny, and secondly a network of gene-to-gene association based on correlated events in scenarios of gene evolution, leading to the definition of co-evolved gene modules. Pantagruel is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/flass/pantagruel.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The family Rhizobiaceae includes many genera of soil bacteria, often isolated for their association with plants. Herein, we investigate the genomic diversity of a group of Rhizobium species and unclassified strains isolated from atypical environments, including seawater, rock matrix or polluted soil. Based on whole-genome similarity and core genome phylogeny, we show that they belong to the genus Pseudorhizobium. We thus reclassify Rhizobium halotolerans, R. marinum, R. flavum and R. endolithicum as P. halotolerans comb. nov., P. marinum comb. nov., P. flavum comb. nov. and R. endolithicum comb. nov., respectively, and show that P. pelagicum is a synonym of P. marinum. We also delineate a new chemolithoautotroph species, P. banfieldii sp. nov., whose type strain is NT-26T (= DSM 106348T = CFBP 8663T). This genome-based classification was independently supported by a chemotaxonomic comparison, with gradual taxonomic resolution provided by fatty acid, protein and metabolic profiles. In addition, we used a phylogenetic approach to infer scenarios of duplication, horizontal transfer and loss for all genes in the Pseudorhizobium pangenome. We thus identify the key functions associated with the diversification of each species and higher clades, shedding light on the mechanisms of adaptation to their respective ecological niches. Respiratory proteins acquired at the origin of Pseudorhizobium are combined with clade-specific genes to encode different strategies for detoxification and nutrition in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Finally, we predict diagnostic phenotypes for the distinction of P. banfieldii from other Pseudorhizobium species, including autotrophy and sensitivity to the azo dye Congo Red, which we experimentally validated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The routine use of genomics for disease surveillance provides the opportunity for high-resolution bacterial epidemiology. Current whole-genome clustering and multilocus typing approaches do not fully exploit core and accessory genomic variation, and they cannot both automatically identify, and subsequently expand, clusters of significantly similar isolates in large data sets spanning entire species. Here, we describe PopPUNK (Population Partitioning Using Nucleotide K-mers), a software implementing scalable and expandable annotation- and alignment-free methods for population analysis and clustering. Variable-length k-mer comparisons are used to distinguish isolates’ divergence in shared sequence and gene content, which we demonstrate to be accurate over multiple orders of magnitude using data from both simulations and genomic collections representing 10 taxonomically widespread species. Connections between closely related isolates of the same strain are robustly identified, despite interspecies variation in the pairwise distance distributions that reflects species’ diverse evolutionary patterns. PopPUNK can process 103–104 genomes in a single batch, with minimal memory use and runtimes up to 200-fold faster than existing model-based methods. Clusters of strains remain consistent as new batches of genomes are added, which is achieved without needing to reanalyze all genomes de novo. This facilitates real-time surveillance with consistent cluster naming between studies and allows for outbreak detection using hundreds of genomes in minutes. Interactive visualization and online publication is streamlined through the automatic output of results to multiple platforms. PopPUNK has been designed as a flexible platform that addresses important issues with currently used whole-genome clustering and typing methods, and has potential uses across bacterial genetics and public health research.},

Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63\% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5\%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17\%), drug-resistance (9\%) and other significant locus effects (7\%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.},

In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past.

We studied the impact of PCV13 introduction with and without CC in Nha Trang, Vietnam - a country that has not yet introduced PCV - through a dynamic transmission model. We modelled the impact on carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of routine vaccination (RV) only and that of RV with CCs targeting {$<$}1y olds (CC1), {$<$}2y olds (CC2) and {$<$}5y olds (CC5). The model was fitted to nasopharyngeal carriage data, and post-PCV predictions were based on best estimates of parameters governing post-PCV dynamics. With RV only, elimination in carriage of vaccine-type (VT) serotypes is predicted to occur across all age groups within 10~years after introduction, with near-complete replacement by non-VT. Most of the benefit of CCs is predicted to occur within the first 3~years with the highest impact at one year, when IPD incidence is predicted to be 11\% (95\%CrI 9 - 14\%) lower than RV with CC1, 25\% (21 - 30 \%) lower with CC2 and 38\% (32 - 46\%) lower with CC5. However, CCs would only prevent more cases of IPD insofar as such campaigns do not delay introduction by more than about 6, 12 and 18~months for CC1, CC2 and CC5. Those findings are important to help guide vaccine introduction in countries that have not yet introduced PCV, particularly in Asia.},

There is also evidence that anti-endomysial (anti-EMA) and anti-gliadin (AGA) antibodies are engaged in PPP development. AIM To assess IL-15, IL-17, IL-22 serum levels and evaluate the presence of anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibodies in patients with PPP. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 20 females of the mean age of 51.8 suffering from PPP. Additionally 29 healthy individuals, age and sex matched, served as controls. ELISA was performed to evaluate serum IL-15, IL-17, IL-22 concentrations while an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIF) was used to determine anti-EMA and AGA presence. RESULTS The mean value of IL-15 and IL-22 serum concentrations was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (IL-15: 6.48 vs. 4.88 pg/ml; IL-22: 81.47 vs. 4.90 pg/ml, respectively; p \textbackslash textless 0.05 for all comparisons). The IL-17 serum level in the study group was higher when compared to the control group (2.0 vs. 0.75 pg/ml), however the results were not statistically significant (p = 0.26). There were no anti-EMA and AGA antibodies detected, both in the control and study group. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained may suggest involvement of IL-15 and IL-22 in the pathogenesis of PPP.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10–20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

The ‘Beijing family’ of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has existed for over 30 000 years, but there is also a more recently evolved ‘modern sublineage’ that spreads more aggressively in human populations. Researchers led by Qian Gao at Fudan University analyzed genomic data from over 1 000 M. tuberculosis isolates to identify dozens of sequence changes specific to this sublineage. Some affect production of proteins on the bacterial surface, which could alter interactions with host cells and the immune system. Others were linked to proteins that control regulatory networks with far-reaching effects, which could shape the extent to which M. tuberculosis can adapt to environmental changes. More thorough characterization of these genomic changes could offer valuable insights into this pathogen’s survival strategies.},

We previously defined 621 Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs) by analysing 20 027 pneumococcal isolates collected worldwide and from previously published genomic data. In this study, we aimed to investigate the pneumococcal lineages behind the predominant serotypes, the mechanism of serotype replacement in disease, as well as the major pneumococcal lineages contributing to invasive pneumococcal disease in the post-vaccine era and their antibiotic resistant traits.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We whole-genome sequenced 3233 invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from laboratory-based surveillance programmes in Hong Kong (n=78), Israel (n=701), Malawi (n=226), South Africa (n=1351), The Gambia (n=203), and the USA (n=674). The genomes represented pneumococci from before and after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introductions and were from children younger than 3 years. We identified predominant serotypes by prevalence and their major contributing lineages in each country, and assessed any serotype replacement by comparing the incidence rate between the pre-PCV and PCV periods for Israel, South Africa, and the USA. We defined the status of a lineage as vaccine-type GPSC (≥50\% 13-valent PCV [PCV13] serotypes) or non-vaccine-type GPSC ({$>$}50\% non-PCV13 serotypes) on the basis of its initial serotype composition detected in the earliest vaccine period to measure their individual contribution toward serotype replacement in each country. Major pneumococcal lineages in the PCV period were identified by pooled incidence rate using a random effects model.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. These serotypes were associated with more than one lineage, except for serotype 5 (GPSC8). Serotype replacement was mainly mediated by expansion of non-vaccine serotypes within vaccine-type GPSCs and, to a lesser extent, by increases in non-vaccine-type GPSCs. A globally spreading lineage, GPSC3, expressing invasive serotypes 8 in South Africa and 33F in the USA and Israel, was the most common lineage causing non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV13 period. We observed that same prevalent non-vaccine serotypes could be associated with distinctive lineages in different countries, which exhibited dissimilar antibiotic resistance profiles. In non-vaccine serotype isolates, we detected significant increases in the prevalence of resistance to penicillin (52 [21\%] of 249 \emph{vs} 169 [29\%] of 575, p=0·0016) and erythromycin (three [1\%] of 249 \emph{vs} 65 [11\%] of 575, p=0·0031) in the PCV13 period compared with the pre-PCV period.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally spreading lineages expressing invasive serotypes have an important role in serotype replacement, and emerging non-vaccine serotypes associated with different pneumococcal lineages in different countries might be explained by local antibiotic-selective pressures.

  abstract = {Metagenomic experiments attempt to characterize microbial communities using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Identification of the microorganisms in a sample provides information about the genetic profile, population structure, and role of microorganisms within an environment. Until recently, most metagenomics studies focused on high-level characterization at the level of phyla, or alternatively sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene that is present in bacterial species. As the cost of sequencing has fallen, though, metagenomics experiments have increasingly used unbiased shotgun sequencing to capture all the organisms in a sample. This approach requires a method for estimating abundance directly from the raw read data. Here we describe a fast, accurate new method that computes the abundance at the species level using the reads collected in a metagenomics experiment. Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN) uses the taxonomic assignments made by Kraken, a very fast read-level classifier, along with information about the genomes themselves to estimate abundance at the species level, the genus level, or above. We demonstrate that Bracken can produce accurate species- and genus-level abundance estimates even when a sample contains multiple near-identical species.},

  abstract = {The seasonal human influenza A/H3N2 virus undergoes rapid evolution, which produces significant year-to-year sequence turnover in the population of circulating strains. Adaptive mutations respond to human immune challenge and occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin. Here we develop a fitness model for haemagglutinin that predicts the evolution of the viral population from one year to the next. Two factors are shown to determine the fitness of a strain: adaptive epitope changes and deleterious mutations outside the epitopes. We infer both fitness components for the strains circulating in a given year, using population-genetic data of all previous strains. From fitness and frequency of each strain, we predict the frequency of its descendent strains in the following year. This fitness model maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests a principled method for vaccine selection. Our results call for a more comprehensive epidemiology of influenza and other fast-evolving pathogens that integrates antigenic phenotypes with other viral functions coupled by genetic linkage.},

Assays without the need for washing steps while still unaffected when analyzing complex biological samples are difficult to develop. Herein, we report a well-characterized nucleic acid proximity-based assay using antibodies, called Proximity Extension Assay (PEA), showing good performance in plasma samples. Target-specific antibody pairs are linked to DNA strands that upon simultaneous binding to the target analyte create a real-time PCR amplicon in a proximity-dependent manner enabled by the action of a DNA polymerase. 3'Exonuclease-capable polymerases were found to be clearly superior in sensitivity over non-3'exonuclease ones. A PEA was set up for IL-8 and GDNF in a user-friendly, homogenous assay displaying femtomolar detection sensitivity, good recovery in human plasma, high specificity and up to 5-log dynamic range in 1 μL samples. Furthermore, we have illustrated the use of a macro-molecular crowding matrix in combination with this homogeneous assay to drive target binding for low-affinity antibodies, thereby improving the sensitivity and increasing affinity reagent availability by lowering assay development dependency on high-affinity antibodies. Assay performance was also confirmed for a multiplex version of PEA.},

  abstract = {A number of methods commonly used in landscape genetics use an analogy to electrical resistance on a network to describe and fit barriers to movement across the landscape using genetic distance data. These are motivated by a mathematical equivalence between electrical resistance between two nodes of a network and the ‘commute time’, which is the mean time for a random walk on that network to leave one node, visit the other, and return. However, genetic data are more accurately modelled by a different quantity, the coalescence time. Here, we describe the differences between resistance distance and coalescence time, and explore the consequences for inference. We implemented a Bayesian method to infer effective movement rates and population sizes under both these models, and found that inference using commute times could produce misleading results in the presence of biased gene flow. We then used forwards-time simulation with continuous geography to demonstrate that coalescence-based inference remains more accurate than resistance-based methods on realistic data, but difficulties highlight the need for methods that explicitly model continuous, heterogeneous geography.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash textlessp\textbackslash textgreaterPsoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that involves mainly T helper (Th)17, Th1 and Th22 lymphocytes, which cause hyper-proliferation of the epidermis with aberrant differentiation of keratinocytes, and local production of chemokines and cytokines. These fuel a self-amplifying loop where these products act on T cells to perpetuate cutaneous inflammatory processes. Among the various inflammatory mediators involved, interleukin (IL)-36 cytokines are important for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and Th17 cells in psoriatic skin. In particular, IL-36s induce chemokines and cytokines interfere with differentiation/cornification programs in the epidermis, as well as promote pathological angiogenesis and endothelial cell activation. IL-36 cytokines belong to the IL-1 family, and comprise IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ agonists as well as IL-36 receptor antagonist and IL-38 antagonists. IL-36 cytokines are up-regulated in psoriatic epidermis, and their expression is strongly induced by TNF-α and IL-17. Contrarily, IL-38 antagonist is downregulated, and its impaired expression may be relevant to the dysregulated inflammatory processes induced by IL-36. Here, we discuss on the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the altered balance of IL-36 agonists/antagonists and the significance of this dysregulation in psoriasis. Collection of the information will provide a theoretical basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on IL-36 agonist/antagonist manipulation in psoriasis.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater},

We describe the genotype diversity in children with culture-confirmed TB and investigate the relationship between genotype and drug resistance. A prospective study was conducted from March 2003 through August 2005 at Tygerberg Children's Hospital, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. All children ({$<$}13 years of age) diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB were included. Genotype analysis and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing were performed on the first culture-positive isolate from each patient. Mutation analysis was performed on all drug-resistant isolates. Spoligotyping was successfully performed on isolates from 391/399 (98\%) children diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB. Drug susceptibility testing was also performed on 391 isolates; 49 (12.5\%) were resistant to isoniazid, and 20 (5.1\%) of these were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Beijing was the most common genotype family, identified in 130/391 (33.2\%) cases, followed by LAM in 114/391 (29.2\%) cases. The presence of both Beijing and Haarlem genotype families was significantly associated with drug resistance (26/49 [53.1\%] versus 113/342 [33.0\%]; odds ratio, 1.7; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.9). The high prevalence of Beijing and LAM in children with culture-confirmed TB reflects considerable transmission of these genotype families within the community. The overrepresentation of Beijing and Haarlem genotype families in children with drug-resistant TB demonstrates their contribution to transmitted drug resistance and their potential importance in the emergent drug-resistant TB epidemic.},

The equilibrium distribution of gene frequencies in structured populations is known since the 1930s, under Wright’s metapopulation model known as the island model. The equivalent distribution for the species frequency (i.e. the species proportional abundance distribution (SPAD)), at the metacommunity level, however, is unknown. In this contribution, we develop a stochastic model to analytically account for this distribution (SPAD). We show that the same as for genes SPAD follows a beta distribution, which provides a good description of empirical data and applies across a continuum of scales. This stochastic model, based upon a diffusion approximation, provides an alternative to neutral models for the species abundance distribution (SAD), which focus on number of individuals instead of proportions, and demonstrate that the relative frequency of genes in local populations and of species within communities follow the same probability law. We hope our contribution will help stimulate the mathematical and conceptual integration of theories in genetics and ecology.},

  abstract = {Joint destruction, as evidenced by radiographic findings, is a significant problem for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Inherently irreversible and frequently progressive, the process of joint damage begins at and even before the clinical onset of disease. However, rheumatoid and psoriatic arthropathies are heterogeneous in nature and not all patients progress to joint damage. It is therefore important to identify patients susceptible to joint destruction in order to initiate more aggressive treatment as soon as possible and thereby potentially prevent irreversible joint damage. At the same time, the high cost and potential side effects associated with aggressive treatment mean it is also important not to over treat patients and especially those who, even if left untreated, would not progress to joint destruction. It is therefore clear that a protein biomarker signature that could predict joint damage at an early stage would support more informed clinical decisions on the most appropriate treatment regimens for individual patients. Although many candidate biomarkers for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis have been reported in the literature, relatively few have reached clinical use and as a consequence the number of prognostic biomarkers used in rheumatology has remained relatively static for several years. It has become evident that a significant challenge in the transition of biomarker candidates to clinical diagnostic assays lies in the development of suitably robust biomarker assays, especially multiplexed assays, and their clinical validation in appropriate patient sample cohorts. Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based targeted quantitative protein measurements have transformed our ability to rapidly develop multiplexed protein biomarker assays. These advances are likely to have a significant impact on the validation of biomarkers in the future. In this review, we have comprehensively compiled a list of candidate biomarkers in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, evaluated the evidence for their potential as biomarkers of bone (joint) damage, and outlined how mass spectrometry-based targeted and multiplexed measurement of candidate biomarker proteins is likely to accelerate their clinical validation and the development of clinical diagnostic tests.},

M. tuberculosis develops drug resistance exclusively through chromosomal mutations, in particular single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Moreover, in laboratory assays the organism exhibits a spontaneous mutation rate that is at the lower end of the bacterial spectrum. Despite this, whole-genome sequencing technology has identified unexpected genetic diversity among clinical M. tuberculosis populations. This suggests that the mycobacterial mutation rate may be modulated within the host and, in turn, implies a potential role for constitutive and/or transient mutator strains in adaptive evolution. It also raises the possibility that environmental factors might act as key mutagens during M. tuberculosis infection. Here we consider the elements that might influence the mycobacterial mutation rate in vivo and evaluate the potential roles of constitutive and transient mutator states in the generation of drug resistance mutations. In addition, we identify key research questions that will influence future efforts to develop novel therapeutic strategies for a disease that continues to impose a significant global health burden.},

  abstract = {Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease. Up to 40 \% of patients with psoriasis will go on to develop PsA, usually within 5-10 years of cutaneous disease onset. Both conditions share common pathogenic mechanisms involving genetic and environmental factors. Because psoriasis is typically present for years before PsA-related joint symptoms emerge, dermatologists are in a unique position to detect PsA earlier in the disease process through regular, routine screening of psoriasis patients. Distinguishing clinical features of PsA include co-occurrence of psoriatic skin lesions and nail dystrophy, as well as dactylitis and enthesitis. Patients with PsA are usually seronegative for rheumatoid factor, and radiographs may reveal unique features such as juxta-articular new bone formation and pencil-in-cup deformity. Early treatment of PsA with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs has the potential to slow disease progression and maintain patient quality of life. Optimally, a single therapeutic agent will control both the skin and joint psoriatic symptoms. A number of traditional treatments used to manage psoriasis, such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, are also effective for PsA, but these agents are often inadequately effective, temporary in benefit and associated with significant safety concerns. Biologic anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, are effective for treating patients who have both psoriasis and PsA. However, a substantial number of patients may lose efficacy, have adverse effects or find intravenous or subcutaneous administration inconvenient. Emerging oral treatments, including phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, such as apremilast, and new biologics targeting interleukin-17, such as secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab, have shown encouraging clinical results in the treatment of psoriasis and/or PsA. Active and regular collaboration of dermatologists with rheumatologists in managing patients who have psoriasis and PsA is likely to yield more optimal control of psoriatic dermal and joint symptoms, and improve long-term patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The microfibril-associated glycoproteins MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are extracellular matrix proteins that interact with fibrillin to influence microfibril function. The two proteins are related through a 60 amino acid matrix-binding domain but their sequences differ outside of this region. A distinguishing feature of both proteins is their ability to interact with TGFβ family growth factors, Notch and Notch ligands, and multiple elastic fiber proteins. MAGP-2 can also interact with αvβ3 integrins via a RGD sequence that is not found in MAGP-1. Morpholino knockdown of MAGP-1 expression in zebrafish resulted in abnormal vessel wall architecture and altered vascular network formation. In the mouse, MAGP-1 deficiency had little effect on elastic fibers in blood vessels and lung but resulted in numerous unexpected phenotypes including bone abnormalities, hematopoietic changes, increased fat deposition, diabetes, impaired wound repair, and a bleeding diathesis. Inactivation of the gene for MAGP-2 in mice produced a neutropenia yet had minimal effects on bone or adipose homeostasis. Double knockouts had phenotypes characteristic of each individual knockout as well as several additional traits only seen when both genes are inactivated. A common mechanism underlying all of the traits associated with the knockout phenotypes is altered TGFβ signaling. This review summarizes our current understanding of the function of the MAGPs and discusses ideas related to their role in growth factor regulation.},

  abstract = {Population genomic studies have shown that genetic draft and background selection can profoundly affect the genome-wide patterns of molecular variation. We performed forward simulations under realistic gene-structure and selection scenarios to investigate whether such linkage effects impinge on the ability of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to infer the rate of positive selection (α) from polymorphism and divergence data. We find that in the presence of slightly deleterious mutations, MK estimates of α severely underestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with population frequencies under 50\% are excluded. Furthermore, already under intermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site frequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under mutation-selection-drift balance. MK-type approaches that first infer demography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to correct the estimation of α obtain almost the correct α in our simulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population expansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting doubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous polymorphism data. We propose a simple asymptotic extension of the MK test that yields accurate estimates of α in our simulations and should provide a fruitful direction for future studies.},

  abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) and the 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are mosquito-borne Flaviviruses that are associated with severe neuronal and hemorrhagic syndromes. The mature flavivirus infectious virion has 90 envelope (E) protein homo-dimers that pack tightly to form a smooth protein coat with icosahedral symmetry. Human antibodies that strongly neutralize ZIKV and DENVs recognize complex quaternary structure epitopes displayed on E-homo-dimers and higher order structures. The ZIKV and DENV E protein expressed as a soluble protein is mainly a monomer that does not display quaternary epitopes, which may explain the modest success with soluble recombinant E (sRecE) as a vaccine and diagnostic antigen. New strategies are needed to design recombinant immunogens that display these critical immune targets. Here we present two novel methods for building or stabilizing in vitro E-protein homo-dimers that display quaternary epitopes. In the first approach we immobilize sRecE to enable subsequent dimer generation. As an alternate method, we describe the use of human mAbs to stabilize homo-dimers in solution. The ability to produce recombinant E protein dimers displaying quaternary structure epitopes is an important advance with applications in flavivirus diagnostics and vaccine development. Zika virus (ZIKV) and the dengue viruses (DENVs) are mosquito-borne members of the flaviviridea family, which can cause severe neurological and hemorrhagic syndromes in humans 1–3 . It is estimated that 400 million DENV infections occur each year and that over half of the world's population live in countries with active DENV or ZIKV transmission 3 . The continuing threat of DENVs and, more recently, ZIKV has stimulated much work on different vaccine platforms including live attenuated virus, inactivated whole virus, protein subunit and DNA vaccines 4–12 . The congenital malformations caused by ZIKV infection during pregnancy has stimulated work on subunit vaccines, as live attenuated and other replicating virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy. Advances in molec-ular biology and bio/nanotechnology have led to the production of recombinant viral proteins with applications in diagnostics and vaccinology. The flavivirus envelope (E) protein is a major target of neutralizing and protec-tive human antibodies, but recombinantly expressed soluble E protein without the C-terminal transmembrane domains has not proven to be particularly effective as a vaccine antigen 13–16},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the geographic extent and connectivity of wildlife populations can provide important insights into the management of disease outbreaks but defining patterns of population structure is difficult for widely distributed species. Landscape genetic analyses are powerful methods for identifying cryptic structure and movement patterns that may be associated with spatial epizootic patterns in such cases. We characterized patterns of population substructure and connectivity using microsatellite genotypes from 2,222 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, a region where chronic wasting disease was first detected in 2009. The goal of this study was to evaluate the juxtaposition between population structure, landscape features that influence gene flow, and current disease management units. Clustering analyses identified four to five subpopulations in this region, the edges of which corresponded to ecophysiographic provinces. Subpopulations were further partitioned into 11 clusters with subtle (FST~≤~0.041), but significant genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation was lower and migration rates were higher among neighboring genetic clusters, indicating an underlying genetic cline. Genetic discontinuities were associated with topographic barriers, however. Resistance surface modeling indicated that gene flow was diffuse in homogenous landscapes, but the direction and extent of gene flow were influenced by forest cover, traffic volume, and elevational relief in subregions heterogeneous for these landscape features. Chronic wasting disease primarily occurred among genetic clusters within a single subpopulation and along corridors of high landscape connectivity. These results may suggest a possible correlation between population substructure, landscape connectivity, and the occurrence of diseases for widespread species. Considering these factors may be useful in delineating effective management units, although only the largest features produced appreciable differences in subpopulation structure. Disease mitigation strategies implemented at the scale of ecophysiographic provinces are likely to be more effective than those implemented at finer scales.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a cytokine of IL-10 family with significant proliferative effect on different cell lines. Immunopathological role of IL-22 has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Here we are reporting the functional role of IL-22 in the inflammatory and proliferative cascades of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHOD From peripheral blood and synovial fluid (SF) of PsA (n = 15), RA (n = 15) and osteoarthritis (OA, n = 15) patients, mononuclear cells were obtained and magnetically sorted for CD3+ T cells. Fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated from the synovial tissue of PsA (n = 5), RA (n = 5) and OA (n = 5) patients. IL-22 levels in SF and serum were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Proliferative effect of human recombinant IL-22 (rIL-22) on FLS was assessed by MTT (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole) and CFSE dilution (Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) assays. Expression of IL-22Rα1 in FLS was determined by western blot. RESULTS IL-22 levels were significantly elevated in SF of PsA patients (17.75 ± 3.46 pg/ml) compared to SF of OA (5.03 ± 0.39 pg/ml), p \textbackslash textless 0.001. In MTT and CFSE dilution assays, rIL-22 (MTT, OD: 1.27 ± 0.06) induced significant proliferation of FLS derived from PsA patients compared to media (OD: 0.53 ± 0.02), p \textbackslash textless 0.001. In addition, rIL-22 induced significantly more proliferation of FLS in presence of TNF-α. IL-22Rα1 was expressed in FLS of PsA, RA and OA patients. Anti IL-22R antibody significantly inhibited the proliferative effect of rIL-22. Further we demonstrated that activated synovial T cells of PsA and RA patients produced significantly more IL-22 than those of OA patients. CONCLUSION SF of PsA patients have higher concentration of IL-22 and rIL-22 induced marked proliferation of PsA derived FLS. Moreover combination of rIL-22 and TNF-α showed significantly more proliferative effect on FLS. IL-22Rα1 was expressed in FLS. Successful inhibition of IL-22 induced FLS proliferation by anti IL-22R antibody suggests that blocking of IL-22/IL-22R interaction may be considered as a novel therapeutic target for PsA.},

  abstract = {Background The 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in Cambodia in January 2015. There are limited data concerning the common serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Knowledge of the circulating pneumococcal serotypes is important to monitor epidemiological changes before and after vaccine implementation. Methods All episodes of IPD defined by the isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood, cerebrospinal fluid or other sterile site in Cambodian children admitted to the Angkor Hospital for Children in Siem Reap, Northwestern Cambodia, between 1st January 2007 and 1st July 2012 were retrospectively studied. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates that could be retrieved underwent phenotypic typing and whole genome sequencing. Results There were 90 Cambodian children hospitalized with IPD with a median (IQR) age of 2.3 years (0.9–6.2). The case fatality was 15.6\% (95\% CI 8–23). Of 50 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates available for further testing, 46\% were penicillin non-susceptible and 8\% were ceftriaxone non-susceptible, 78\% were cotrimoxazole resistant, 30\% were erythromycin resistant and 30\% chloramphenicol resistant. There were no significant changes in resistance levels over the five-year period. The most common serotypes were 1 (11/50; 22\%), 23F (8/50; 16\%), 14 (6/50; 12\%), 5 (5/50; 10\%) and 19A (3/50; 6\%). Coverage by PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 was 44\%, 76\% and 92\% respectively. We identified novel multilocus sequence types and resistotypes using whole genome sequencing. Conclusions This study suggests IPD is an important disease in Cambodian children and can have a significant mortality. PCV13 coverage of the serotypes determined in studied strains was high and consistent with another recent study. The phenotypic resistance patterns observed were similar to other regional studies. The use of whole genome sequencing in the present study provides additional typing and resistance information together with the description of novel sequence types and resistotypes.},

The main pneumococcal autolysin LytA and the pneumolysin Ply are two of the bacterium’s most important virulence factors. The lytA- and ply-related genes are also found in other streptococci of the Mitis group (SMG). The precise characteristics of the lytA-related—but not the ply-related—genes of SMG and their prophages have been previously described. A search of the more than 400 SMG genomic sequences available in public databases (ca. 300 for S. pneumoniae), showed Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae IS7493 to harbor four ply-related genes, two of which (plyA and plyB) have 98\% identical nucleotides. The plyA homolog of S. pseudopneumoniae is conserved in all S. pneumoniae strains, and seems to be included in a pathogenicity island together with the lytA gene. However, only nonencapsulated S. pneumoniae strains possess a plyB gene, which is part of an integrative and conjugative element. Notably, the existence of a bacterial lytA-related gene in a genome is linked to the presence of plyA and vice versa. The present analysis also shows there are eight main types of plyA−lytA genomic islands. A possible stepwise scenario for the evolution of the plyA−lytA island in S. pneumoniae is proposed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Inferring gene trees is difficult because alignments are often too short, and thus contain insufficient signal, while substitution models inevitably fail to capture the complexity of the evolutionary processes. To overcome these challenges species tree-aware methods seek to use information from a putative species tree. However, there are few methods available that implement a full likelihood framework or account for horizontal gene transfers. Furthermore, these methods often require expensive data pre-processing (e.g., computing bootstrap trees), and rely on approximations and heuristics that limit the exploration of tree space. Here we present GeneRax, the first maximum likelihood species tree-aware gene tree inference software. It simultaneously accounts for substitutions at the sequence level and gene level events, such as duplication, transfer and loss and uses established maximum likelihood optimization algorithms. GeneRax can infer rooted gene trees for an arbitrary number of gene families, directly from the per-gene sequence alignments and a rooted, but undated, species tree. We show that compared to competing tools, on simulated data GeneRax infers trees that are the closest to the true tree in 90\% of the simulations in terms relative Robinson-Foulds distance. While, on empirical datasets, GeneRax is the fastest among all tested methods when starting from aligned sequences, and that it infers trees with the highest likelihood score, based on our model. GeneRax completed tree inferences and reconciliations for 1099 Cyanobacteria families in eight minutes on 512 CPU cores. Thus, its advanced parallelization scheme enables large-scale analyses.

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease, and global TB control efforts are increasingly threatened by drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unlike most bacteria, where lateral gene transfer is an important mechanism of resistance acquisition, resistant M. tuberculosis arises solely by de novo chromosomal mutation. Using whole-genome sequencing data from two natural populations of M. tuberculosis, we characterized the population genetics of known drug resistance loci using measures of diversity, population differentiation, and convergent evolution. We found resistant subpopulations to be less diverse than susceptible subpopulations, consistent with ongoing transmission of resistant M. tuberculosis. A subset of resistance genes ("sloppy targets") were characterized by high diversity and multiple rare variants; we posit that a large genetic target for resistance and relaxation of purifying selection contribute to high diversity at these loci. For "tight targets" of selection, the path to resistance appeared narrower, evidenced by single favored mutations that arose numerous times in the phylogeny and segregated at markedly different frequencies in resistant and susceptible subpopulations. These results suggest that diverse genetic architectures underlie drug resistance in M. tuberculosis and that combined approaches are needed to identify causal mutations. Extrapolating from patterns observed for well-characterized genes, we identified novel candidate variants involved in resistance. The approach outlined here can be extended to identify resistance variants for new drugs, to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance, and when phenotypic data are available, to find candidate genetic loci underlying other positively selected traits in clonal bacteria. IMPORTANCEMycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a significant burden on global health. Antibiotic treatment imposes strong selective pressure on M. tuberculosis populations. Identifying the mutations that cause drug resistance in M. tuberculosis is important for guiding TB treatment and halting the spread of drug resistance. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of M. tuberculosis isolates can be used to identify novel mutations mediating drug resistance and to predict resistance patterns faster than traditional methods of drug susceptibility testing. We have used WGS from natural populations of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis to characterize effects of selection for advantageous mutations on patterns of diversity at genes involved in drug resistance. The methods developed here can be used to identify novel advantageous mutations, including new resistance loci, in M. tuberculosis and other clonal pathogens.},

  abstract = {Prokaryotic evolution is affected by horizontal transfer of genetic material through recombination. Inference of an evolutionary tree of bacteria thus relies on accurate identification of the population genetic structure and recombination-derived mosaicism. Rapidly growing databases represent a challenge for computational methods to detect recombinations in bacterial genomes. We introduce a novel algorithm called fastGEAR which identifies lineages in diverse microbial alignments, and recombinations between them and from external origins. The algorithm detects both recent recombinations (affecting a few isolates) and ancestral recombinations between detected lineages (affecting entire lineages), thus providing insight into recombinations affecting deep branches of the phylogenetic tree. In simulations, fastGEAR had comparable power to detect recent recombinations and outstanding power to detect the ancestral ones, compared with state-of-the-art methods, often with a fraction of computational cost. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analyzing a collection of 616 whole-genomes of a recombinogenic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which the method provided a high-resolution view of recombination across the genome. We examined in detail the penicillin-binding genes across the Streptococcus genus, demonstrating previously undetected genetic exchanges between different species at these three loci. Hence, fastGEAR can be readily applied to investigate mosaicism in bacterial genes across multiple species. Finally, fastGEAR correctly identified many known recombination hotspots and pointed to potential new ones. Matlab code and Linux/Windows executables are available at https://users.ics.aalto.fi/\textasciitilde pemartti/fastGEAR/ (last accessed February 6, 2017).},

  abstract = {Diversity of the polysaccharide capsule in Streptococcus pneumoniae—main surface antigen and the target of the currently used pneumococcal vaccines—constitutes a major obstacle in eliminating pneumococcal disease. Such diversity is genetically encoded by almost 100 variants of the capsule biosynthesis locus, cps. However, the evolutionary dynamics of the capsule remains not fully understood. Here, using genetic data from 4,519 bacterial isolates, we found cps to be an evolutionary hotspot with elevated substitution and recombination rates. These rates were a consequence of relaxed purifying selection and positive, diversifying selection acting at this locus, supporting the hypothesis that the capsule has an increased potential to generate novel diversity compared with the rest of the genome. Diversifying selection was particularly evident in the region of wzd/wze genes, which are known to regulate capsule expression and hence the bacterium’s ability to cause disease. Using a novel, capsule-centered approach, we analyzed the evolutionary history of 12 major serogroups. Such analysis revealed their complex diversification scenarios, which were principally driven by recombination with other serogroups and other streptococci. Patterns of recombinational exchanges between serogroups could not be explained by serotype frequency alone, thus pointing to nonrandom associations between co-colonizing serotypes. Finally, we discovered a previously unobserved mosaic serotype 39X, which was confirmed to carry a viable and structurally novel capsule. Adding to previous discoveries of other mosaic capsules in densely sampled collections, these results emphasize the strong adaptive potential of the bacterium by its ability to generate novel antigenic diversity by recombination.},

The bacterial foodborne pathogen             Listeria monocytogenes             clonal complex 1 (             Lm             -CC1) is the most prevalent clonal group associated with listeriosis, and is strongly associated with cattle and dairy products. Here we analysed 2,021             Lm             -CC1 isolates collected from 40 countries, since the first             Lm             isolation to the present day, to define its evolutionary history and population dynamics. Our results suggest that             Lm             -CC1 spread worldwide from North America following the Industrial Revolution through two waves of expansion, coinciding with the transatlantic livestock trade in the second half of the 19             th             century and the rapid growth of cattle farming in the 20             th             century.             Lm             -CC1 then firmly established at a local level, with limited inter-country spread. This study provides an unprecedented insight into             Lm             -CC1 phylogeography and dynamics and can contribute to effective disease surveillance to reduce the burden of listeriosis.},

Little is known about the expression of IgA proteases in clinical settings of H. influenzae infection. METHODS: We identified and characterized IgA protease genes in H. influenzae and studied their expression and proteolytic specificity, in vitro and in vivo in 169 independent strains of H. influenzae collected longitudinally over 10 years from adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: The H. influenzae pangenome has 2 alleles of IgA protease genes; all strains have igaA, and 40\% of strains have igaB. Each allele has 2 variants with differing proteolytic specificities for human IgA1. A total of 88\% of 169 strains express IgA protease activity. Expression of the 4 forms of IgA protease varies among strains. Based on the presence of IgA1 fragments in sputum samples, each of the different forms of IgA protease is selectively expressed in the human airways during infection. CONCLUSIONS: Four variants of IgA proteases are variably expressed by H. influenzae during infection of the human airways.},

GBD 2019 covered 204 countries and territories, as well as first administrative level disaggregations for 22 countries, from 1990 to 2019. Because GBD is highly standardised and comprehensive, spanning both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, and uses a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of hierarchical disease and injury causes, the study provides a powerful basis for detailed and broad insights on global health trends and emerging challenges. GBD 2019 incorporates data from 281\hphantom{,}586 sources and provides more than 3·5 billion estimates of health outcome and health system measures of interest for global, national, and subnational policy dialogue. All GBD estimates are publicly available and adhere to the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. From this vast amount of information, five key insights that are important for health, social, and economic development strategies have been distilled. These insights are subject to the many limitations outlined in each of the component GBD capstone papers.},

  abstract = {Vibrio cholerae is a globally important pathogen that is endemic in many areas of the world and causes 3-5 million reported cases of cholera every year. Historically, there have been seven acknowledged cholera pandemics; recent outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Haiti are included in the seventh and ongoing pandemic. Only isolates in serogroup O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as 'classical' and 'El Tor') and the derivative O139 can cause epidemic cholera. It is believed that the first six cholera pandemics were caused by the classical biotype, but El Tor has subsequently spread globally and replaced the classical biotype in the current pandemic. Detailed molecular epidemiological mapping of cholera has been compromised by a reliance on sub-genomic regions such as mobile elements to infer relationships, making El Tor isolates associated with the seventh pandemic seem superficially diverse. To understand the underlying phylogeny of the lineage responsible for the current pandemic, we identified high-resolution markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in 154 whole-genome sequences of globally and temporally representative V. cholerae isolates. Using this phylogeny, we show here that the seventh pandemic has spread from the Bay of Bengal in at least three independent but overlapping waves with a common ancestor in the 1950s, and identify several transcontinental transmission events. Additionally, we show how the acquisition of the SXT family of antibiotic resistance elements has shaped pandemic spread, and show that this family was first acquired at least ten years before its discovery in V. cholerae.},

  abstract = {Expression of a polysaccharide capsule is required for the full pathogenicity of many mucosal pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although capsule allows for evasion of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis during invasive infection, its role during mucosal colonization, the organism's commensal state, remains unknown. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that unencapsulated mutants remain capable of nasal colonization but at a reduced density and duration compared to those of their encapsulated parent strains. This deficit in colonization was not due to increased susceptibility to opsonophagocytic clearance involving complement, antibody, or the influx of Ly-6G-positive cells, including neutrophils seen during carriage. Rather, unencapsulated mutants remain agglutinated within lumenal mucus and, thus, are less likely to transit to the epithelial surface where stable colonization occurs. Studies of in vitro binding to immobilized human airway mucus confirmed the inhibitory effect of encapsulation. Likewise, pneumococcal variants expressing larger amounts of negatively charged capsule per cell were less likely to adhere to surfaces coated with human mucus and more likely to evade initial clearance in vivo. Removal of negatively charged sialic acid residues by pretreatment of mucus with neuraminidase diminished the antiadhesive effect of encapsulation. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of encapsulation on mucus binding may be mediated by electrostatic repulsion and offers an explanation for the predominance of anionic polysaccharides among the diverse array of unique capsule types. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that capsule confers an advantage to mucosal pathogens distinct from its role in inhibition of opsonophagocytosis—escape from entrapment in lumenal mucus.},

  abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7\% and 47.1\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3–97.1\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

  abstract = {Echinococcosis or hydatid disease (HD) is a zoonosis caused by the larval stages of taeniid cestodes belonging to the genus Echinococcus. Hepatic echinococcosis is a life-threatening disease, mainly differentiated into alveolar and cystic forms, associated with Echinoccus multilocularis (E. multilocularis) and Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus) infection, respectively. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) has a worldwide distribution, while hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is endemic in the Northern hemisphere, including North America and several Asian and European countries, like France, Germany and Austria. E. granulosus young cysts are spherical, unilocular vesicles, consisting of an internal germinal layer and an outer acellular layer. Cyst expansion is associated with a host immune reaction and the subsequent development of a fibrous layer, called the pericyst; old cysts typically present internal septations and daughter cysts. E. multilocularis has a tumor-like, infiltrative behavior, which is responsible for tissue destruction and finally for liver failure. The liver is the main site of HD involvement, for both alveolar and cystic hydatidosis. HD is usually asymptomatic for a long period of time, because cyst growth is commonly slow; the most frequent symptoms are fatigue and abdominal pain. Patients may also present jaundice, hepatomegaly or anaphylaxis, due to cyst leakage or rupture. HD diagnosis is usually accomplished with the combined use of ultrasonography and immunodiagnosis; furthermore, the improvement of surgical techniques, the introduction of minimally invasive treatments [such as puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration (PAIR)] and more effective drugs (such as benzoimidazoles) have deeply changed life expectancy and quality of life of patients with HD. The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of biological, diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of hepatic echinococcosis.},

  abstract = {Signatures of balancing selection operating on specific gene loci in endemic pathogens can identify candidate targets of naturally acquired immunity. In malaria parasites, several leading vaccine candidates convincingly show such signatures when subjected to several tests of neutrality, but the discovery of new targets affected by selection to a similar extent has been slow. A small minority of all genes are under such selection, as indicated by a recent study of 26 Plasmodium falciparum merozoite-stage genes that were not previously prioritized as vaccine candidates, of which only one (locus PF10\_0348) showed a strong signature. Therefore, to focus discovery efforts on genes that are polymorphic, we scanned all available shotgun genome sequence data from laboratory lines of P. falciparum and chose six loci with more than five single nucleotide polymorphisms per kilobase (including PF10\_0348) for in-depth frequency-based analyses in a Kenyan population (allele sample sizes {$>$}50 for each locus) and comparison of Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade (HKA) ratios of population diversity (π) to interspecific divergence (K) from the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi. Three of these (the msp3/6-like genes PF10\_0348 and PF10\_0355 and the surf(4.1) gene PFD1160w) showed exceptionally high positive values of Tajima's D and Fu and Li's F indices and have the highest HKA ratios, indicating that they are under balancing selection and should be prioritized for studies of their protein products as candidate targets of immunity. Combined with earlier results, there is now strong evidence that high HKA ratio (as well as the frequency-independent ratio of Watterson's /K) is predictive of high values of Tajima's D. Thus, the former offers value for use in genome-wide screening when numbers of genome sequences within a species are low or in combination with Tajima's D as a 2D test on large population genomic samples.},

While bottom-up proteomics methods are approaching comprehensive coverage of even complex eukaryotic proteomes, failing to reliably quantify lower abundance proteins can limit the precision and reach of experiments to much less than the identifiedlet alone totalproteome. Here we test the ability of two common methods, a tandem mass tagging (TMT) method and a label-free quantitation method (LFQ), to achieve comprehensive quantitative coverage by benchmarking their capacity to measure 3 different levels of change (3-, 2-, and 1.5-fold) across an entire data set. Both methods achieved comparably accurate estimates for all 3-fold-changes. However, the TMT method detected changes that reached statistical significance three times more often due to higher precision and fewer missing values. These findings highlight the importance of refining proteome quantitation methods to bring the number of usefully quantified proteins into closer agreement with the number of total quantified proteins.},

  abstract = {The ZmpC zinc metalloproteinase of Streptococcus pneumoniae, annotated in the type 4 genome as SP0071, was found to cleave human matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). The previously described IgA protease activity was confirmed to be specifically linked to the IgA1-protease/SP1154 zinc metalloproteinase. MMP-9 is a protease cleaving extracellular matrix gelatin and collagen and is activated by proteolytic cleavage like most proteases. MMP-9 is a human protease and is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological matrix degrading processes, including tissue invasion of metastases and opening of the blood-brain barrier. While TIGR4 (serotype 4) and G54 (serotype 19) pneumococcal genome strains have a highly conserved copy of zmpC, the genome of R6 (a derivative of serotype 2 D39 strain) lacks zmpC. Both the analysis for zmpC presence and MMP-9 cleavage activity in various pneumococcal strains showed correlation of ZmpC with MMP-9 cleavage activity. When assaying clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, the zmpC gene was not found in any of the nasal and conjunctival swab isolates, but it was present in 1 out of 13 meningitis isolates and in 6 out of 11 pneumonia isolates. In a murine pneumonia model, infection with a zmpC-mutant reduced mortality at 3-4 days post-infection by 75\%, when compared with infection with wild-type strains. These data indicate that the ZmpC pneumococcal protease may play a role in pneumococcal virulence and pathogenicity in the lung.},

We applied the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America criteria to differentiate between colonisation and disease. Only 37 articles from 373 citations met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of pulmonary NTM colonization was 7.5\% (95\% CI: 7.2\%–7.8\%), and 75.0\% (2325 of 3096) occurred in males, 16.5\% (512 of 3096) in those previously treated for tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex predominated (27.7\% [95\% CI: 27.2–28.9\%]). In seven eligible studies, 27.9\% (266 of 952) of participants had pulmonary NTM disease and M. kansasii with a prevalence of 69.2\% [95\% CI: 63.2–74.7\%] was the most common cause of pulmonary NTM disease. NTM species were unidentifiable in 29.2\% [2,623 of 8,980] of isolates. In conclusion, pulmonary NTM disease is a neglected and emerging public health disease and enhanced surveillance is required.},

We applied whole-genome sequence-based phylogenetic methods to define the population structure of sub-Saharan African invasive Salmonella Typhimurium and compared these to global Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. Notably, the vast majority of sub-Saharan invasive Salmonella Typhimurium fell within two closely-related, highly-clustered phylogenetic lineages that we estimate emerged independently \textasciitilde 52 and \textasciitilde 35 years ago, in close temporal association with the current HIV pandemic. Clonal replacement of isolates of lineage I by lineage II was potentially influenced by the use of chloramphenicol for the treatment of iNTS disease. Our analysis suggests that iNTS disease is in part an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa caused by highly related Salmonella Typhimurium lineages that may have occupied new niches associated with a compromised human population and antibiotic treatment.},

The mosquito vector that transmits this virus is widespread and responsible for the spread of other arboviridae including Dengue. Current diagnostic methods rely on serologic testing that are complicated by cross reactivity and therefore unable to distinguish Zika from Dengue infection in the absence of virus isolation. We performed an in silico analysis to identify potential epitopes that may stimulate a unique T-lymphocyte response to distinguish prior infection with Zika or Dengue. From this analysis, we not only identified epitopes unique to Zika and Dengue, but also identified epitopes unique to each Dengue serotype. These peptides contribute to a pool of peptides identified for vaccine development that can be tested in vitro to confirm immunogenicity, absence of homology and global population coverage. The current lack of accurate diagnostic testing hampers our ability to understand the scope of the epidemic, implications for vaccine implementation and complications related to monoinfection and co-infection with these two closely related viruses.},

  abstract = {Vibrio metoecus is the closest relative of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the potent diarrheal disease cholera. Although the pathogenic potential of this new species is yet to be studied in depth, it has been co-isolated with V. cholerae in coastal waters and found in clinical specimens in the United States. We used these two organisms to investigate the genetic interaction between closely related species in their natural environment. The genomes of 20 V. cholerae and 4 V. metoecus strains isolated from a brackish coastal pond on the US east coast, as well as 4 clinical V. metoecus strains were sequenced and compared with reference strains. Whole genome comparison shows 86–87\% average nucleotide identity (ANI) in their core genes between the two species. On the other hand, the chromosomal integron, which occupies approximately 3\% of their genomes, shows higher conservation in ANI between species than any other region of their genomes. The ANI of 93–94\% observed in this region is not significantly greater within than between species, meaning that it does not follow species boundaries. Vibrio metoecus does not encode toxigenic V. cholerae major virulence factors, the cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus. However, some of the pathogenicity islands found in pandemic V. cholerae were either present in the common ancestor it shares with V. metoecus, or acquired by clinical and environmental V. metoecus in partial fragments. The virulence factors of V. cholerae are therefore both more ancient and more widespread than previously believed. There is high interspecies recombination in the core genome, which has been detected in 24\% of the single-copy core genes, including genes involved in pathogenicity. Vibrio metoecus was six times more often the recipient of DNA from V. cholerae as it was the donor, indicating a strong bias in the direction of gene transfer in the environment.},

  abstract = {Background Drug resistance surveillance is crucial for tuberculosis (TB) control. Therefore, our goal was to determine the prevalence of second-line anti-TB drug resistance among diverse primary drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates in Ghana. Materials and methods One hundred and seventeen MTBC isolates with varying first-line drug resistance were analyzed. Additional resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs (streptomycin [STR], amikacin [AMK] and moxifloxacin [MOX]) was profiled using the Etest and GenoType MTBDRsl version 2.0. Genes associated with resistance to AMK and MOX (gyrA, gyrB, eis, rrs, tap, whiB7 and tlyA) were then analyzed for mutation. Results Thirty-seven (31.9\%) isolates had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ≥2 µg/mL against STR while 12 (10.3\%) isolates had MIC values ≥1 µg/mL for AMK. Only one multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate (Isolate ID: TB/Nm 919) had an MIC value of ≥0.125 µg/mL for MOX (MIC = 3 µg/mL). This isolate also had the highest MIC value for AMK (MIC = 16 µg/mL) and was confirmed as resistant to AMK and MOX by the line probe assay GenoType MTBDRsl version 2.0. Mutations associated with the resistance were: gyrA (G88C) and rrs (A514C and A1401G). Conclusion Our findings suggest the need to include routine second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility testing of MDR/rifampicin-resistant isolates in our diagnostic algorithm.},

  abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) stimulates numerous cellular activities capable of contributing to the metastatic phenotype, including growth, motility, invasiveness, and morphogenetic transformation. When inappropriately expressed in vivo, an HGF/SF transgene induces numerous hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. NK1 and NK2 are natural splice variants of HGF/SF; all interact with a common receptor, Met. Although both agonistic and antagonistic properties have been ascribed to each isoform in vitro, NK1 retains the full spectrum of HGF/SF-like activities when expressed as a transgene in vivo. Here we report that transgenic mice broadly expressing NK2 exhibit none of the phenotypes characteristic of HGF/SF or NK1 transgenic mice. Instead, when coexpressed in NK2-HGF/SF bitransgenic mice, NK2 antagonizes the pathological consequences of HGF/SF and discourages the subcutaneous growth of transplanted Met-containing melanoma cells. Remarkably, the metastatic efficiency of these same melanoma cells is dramatically enhanced in NK2 transgenic host mice relative to wild-type recipients, rivaling levels achieved in HGF/SF and NK1 transgenic hosts. Considered in conjunction with reports that in vitro NK2 induces scatter, but not other activities, these data strongly suggest that cellular motility is a critical determinant of metastasis. Moreover, our results demonstrate how alternatively structured ligands can be exploited in vivo to functionally dissociate Met-mediated activities and their downstream pathways.},

We represent genotype information of MTBC strains in a high-dimensional array in order to include information about spoligotype, MIRU, and their coexistence using multiple-biomarker tensors. We use multiway models to transform this multidimensional data about the MTBC strains into two-dimensional arrays and use the resulting score vectors in a stable partitive clustering algorithm to classify MTBC strains into sublineages. We validate clusterings using cluster stability and accuracy measures, and find stabilities of each cluster. Based on validated clustering results, we present a sublineage structure of MTBC strains and compare it to the sublineage structures of SpolDB4 and MIRU-VNTRplus.},

  abstract = {Modern DNA sequencing technologies enable geneticists to rapidly identify genetic variation among many human genomes. However, isolating the minority of variants underlying disease remains an important, yet formidable challenge for medical genetics. We have developed GEMINI (GEnome MINIng), a flexible software package for exploring all forms of human genetic variation. Unlike existing tools, GEMINI integrates genetic variation with a diverse and adaptable set of genome annotations (e.g., dbSNP, ENCODE, UCSC, ClinVar, KEGG) into a unified database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration. Whereas other methods provide an inflexible set of variant filters or prioritization methods, GEMINI allows researchers to compose complex queries based on sample genotypes, inheritance patterns, and both pre-installed and custom genome annotations. GEMINI also provides methods for ad hoc queries and data exploration, a simple programming interface for custom analyses that leverage the underlying database, and both command line and graphical tools for common analyses. We demonstrate GEMINI's utility for exploring variation in personal genomes and family based genetic studies, and illustrate its ability to scale to studies involving thousands of human samples. GEMINI is designed for reproducibility and flexibility and our goal is to provide researchers with a standard framework for medical genomics.},

  abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a widely endemic helminthic disease caused by infection with metacestodes (larval stage) of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. E. granulosus are common parasites in certain parts of the world, and are present on every continent with the exception of Antarctica. As a result, a large number of people are affected by CE. The increased emigration of populations from endemic areas where prevalence rates are as high as 5-10\% and the relatively quiescent clinical course of CE pose challenges for accurate and timely diagnoses. Upon infection with CE, cyst formation mainly occurs in the liver (70\%). Diagnosis involves serum serologic testing for antibodies against hydatid antigens, but preferably with imaging by ultrasound or CT/MRI. Treatment methods include chemotherapy with benzimidazole carbamates and/or surgical approaches, including percutaneous aspiration injection and reaspiration. The success of these methods is influenced by the stage and location of hepatic cysts. However, CE can be clinically silent, and has a high risk for recurrence. It is important to consider the echinococcal parasite in the differential diagnosis of liver cystic lesions, especially in patients of foreign origin, and to perform appropriate long-term follow-ups. The aim of this review is to highlight the epidemiology, natural history, diagnostic methods, and treatment of liver disease caused by E. granulosus.},

Here, we analyze sequences from 232 patients sampled over 7~months in Sierra Leone, along with 86 previously released genomes from earlier in the epidemic. We confirm sustained human-to-human transmission within Sierra Leone and find no evidence for import or export of EBOV across national borders after its initial introduction. Using high-depth replicate sequencing, we observe both host-to-host transmission and recurrent emergence of intrahost genetic variants. We trace the increasing impact of purifying selection in suppressing the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations over time. Finally, we~note changes in the mucin-like domain of EBOV glycoprotein that merit further investigation. These findings clarify the movement of EBOV within the region and describe viral evolution during prolonged human-to-human transmission.},

  abstract = {Since nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus precedes invasive pneumococcal disease, characteristics of carriage isolates could be incorrectly assumed to reflect those of invasive isolates. While most pneumococci express a capsular polysaccharide, nontypeable pneumococci are sometimes isolated. Carriage nontypeables tend to encode novel surface proteins in place of a capsular polysaccharide synthetic locus, the cps locus. In contrast, capsular polysaccharide is believed to be indispensable for invasive pneumococcal disease, and nontypeables from population-based invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance have not been extensively characterized. We received 14,328 invasive pneumococcal isolates through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance program during 2006–2009. Isolates that were nontypeable by Quellung serotyping were characterized by PCR serotyping, sequence analyses of the cps locus, and multilocus sequence typing. Eighty-eight isolates were Quellung-nontypeable (0.61\%). Of these, 79 (89.8\%) contained cps loci. Twenty-two nontypeables exhibited serotype 8 cps loci with defects, primarily within wchA. Six of the remaining nine isolates contained previously-described aliB homologs in place of cps loci. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that most nontypeables that lacked capsular biosynthetic genes were related to established non-encapsulated lineages. Thus, invasive pneumococcal disease caused by nontypeable pneumococcus remains rare in the United States, and while carriage nontypeables lacking cps loci are frequently isolated, such nontypeable are extremely rare in invasive pneumococcal disease. Most invasive nontypeable pneumococci possess defective cps locus genes, with an over-representation of defective serotype 8 cps variants.},

  abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a key mediator of angiogenesis, signalling via the class IV tyrosine kinase receptor family of VEGF Receptors (VEGFRs). Although VEGF-A ligands bind to both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, they primarily signal via VEGFR2 leading to endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration and vascular permeability. Distinct VEGF-A isoforms result from alternative splicing of the Vegfa gene at exon 8, resulting in VEGFxxxa or VEGFxxxb isoforms. Alternative splicing events at exons 5⁻7, in addition to recently identified posttranslational read-through events, produce VEGF-A isoforms that differ in their bioavailability and interaction with the co-receptor Neuropilin-1. This review explores the molecular pharmacology of VEGF-A isoforms at VEGFR2 in respect to ligand binding and downstream signalling. To understand how VEGF-A isoforms have distinct signalling despite similar affinities for VEGFR2, this review re-evaluates the typical classification of these isoforms relative to the prototypical, \&ldquo;pro-angiogenic\&rdquo; VEGF165a. We also examine the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of VEGF-A isoform signalling and the importance of interactions with other membrane and extracellular matrix proteins. As approved therapeutics targeting the VEGF-A/VEGFR signalling axis largely lack long-term efficacy, understanding these isoform-specific mechanisms could aid future drug discovery efforts targeting VEGF receptor pharmacology.},

A comparison of recombination levels and diversity at seven housekeeping genes for eleven bacterial species, most of which are commonly cited as having high levels of lateral gene transfer shows that the relative contributions of homologous recombination versus mutation for Burkholderia pseudomallei is over two times higher than for Streptococcus pneumoniae and is thus the highest value yet reported in bacteria. Despite the potential for homologous recombination to increase diversity, B. pseudomallei exhibits a relative lack of diversity at these loci. In these situations, whole genome genotyping of orthologous shared single nucleotide polymorphism loci, discovered using next generation sequencing technologies, can provide very large data sets capable of estimating core phylogenetic relationships. We compared and searched 43 whole genome sequences of B. pseudomallei and its closest relatives for single nucleotide polymorphisms in orthologous shared regions to use in phylogenetic reconstruction.},

  abstract = {.Streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly impactful bacterial pathogen on a global scale. The principal pneumococcal virulence factor and target of effective vaccines is its polysaccharide capsule, of which there are many structurally distinct forms. Here we describe four distinct strains of three Mitis group commensal species (Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus oralis) recovered from upper respiratory tract specimens from adults in Kenya and the United States that were PCR-positive for the pneumococcal serotype 5 specific gene, wzy5. For each of the 4 strains, the 15 genes comprising the capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic gene cluster (cps5) shared the same order found in serotype 5 pneumococci, and each of the five serotype 5-specific genes from the serotype 5 pneumococcal reference strain shared 76 – 99\% sequence identity with the non-pneumococcal counterparts. Double-diffusion experiments demonstrated specific reactivity with pneumococcal serotype 5 typing sera. Antiserum raised against S. mitis strain KE67013 specifically reacted with serotype 5 pneumococci for a positive Quellung reaction and stimulated serotype 5 specific opsonophagocytic killing of pneumococci. Four additional commensal strains, identified using PCR serotyping assays on pharyngeal specimens, revealeded cps loci highly homologous to those of pneumococci of serotypes 12F, 15A, 18C, and 33F. These data, in particular the species and strain diversity shown for serotype 5, highlight the existence of a broad non-pneumococcal species reservoir in the upper respiratory tract for the expression of capsular polysaccharides that are structurally related or identical to those expressed by many different pneumococcal serotypes. Very little is known about the genetic and antigenic capsular diversity among the vast array of commensal streptococcal strains that represent multiple diverse species. This discovery of serotype 5 strains within three different commensal species is suggestive that extensive capsular serologic overlap exists between pneumococci and other members of the diverse Mitis group. These findings may have implications for our current understanding of naturally acquired immunity to S. pneumoniae and pneumococcal serotype distributions in different global regions. Further characterization of commensal strains carrying homologs of serotype-specific genes previously thought to be specific for pneumococci of known serotypes may shed light on the evolution of these important loci.},

  abstract = {Background We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. Conclusions/Significance FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

ZIKV shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology compared with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), resulting in immunological cross-reactivity. Improving our current understanding of the extent and characteristics of this immunological cross-reactivity is important, as ZIKV is presently circulating in areas that are highly endemic for dengue. To assess the magnitude and functional quality of cross-reactive immune responses between these closely related viruses, we tested acute and convalescent sera from nine Thai patients with PCR-confirmed DENV infection against ZIKV. All of the sera tested were cross-reactive with ZIKV, both in binding and in neutralization. To deconstruct the observed serum cross-reactivity in depth, we also characterized a panel of DENV-specific plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for activity against ZIKV. Nearly half of the 47 DENV-reactive mAbs studied bound to both whole ZIKV virion and ZIKV lysate, of which a subset also neutralized ZIKV. In addition, both sera and mAbs from the dengue-infected patients enhanced ZIKV infection of Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that preexisting immunity to DENV may impact protective immune responses against ZIKV. In addition, the extensive cross-reactivity may have implications for ZIKV virulence and disease severity in DENV-experienced populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract The dynamic analysis of geographical distribution is relevant to identify the processes that underlie any changes of geographical ranges. This is an essential element of both biogeography and conservation biology. Fuzzy logic, in particular the fuzzy concept of favourability for species occurrence, helps to perform a dynamic interpretation of the internal complexity of species ranges. We modelled the distributions of the 222 Iberian butterflies using favourability functions and 92 environmental variables (spatial, climatic, topographic, geological and indicators of human activity). We obtained a significant environmental favourability model for each butterfly. We identified the potential sources and sinks in the distribution area of each butterfly species using their respective favourability and presence?absence maps, considering as sources only those areas with high favourability where the butterfly is present, and sinks only those areas with low favourability where the butterfly is present too. The source areas for the Iberian butterflies are concentrated in the north of the peninsula, mainly in the mountain ranges (Cantabrian Range, Pyrenees and Central Range). Sink areas are more dispersed all around the peninsula. We found a concentration of sink locations in eastern Iberia (Alicante and Murcia provinces) and in the southwestern area (Doñana National Park). This may be helpful when implementing conservation measures, by providing a biogeographical dynamic interpretation of the roles of different parts of the distribution range of the species. Preserving the processes that link sources with sinks is critical for maintaining or improving the sustainability of populations.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

  abstract = {Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) for viral infections, such as HIV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza, are increasingly entering clinical development. For influenza, most neutralizing antibodies target influenza virus hemagglutinin. These bNAbs represent an emerging, promising modality for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza due to their multiple mechanisms of antiviral action and generally safe profile. Preclinical work in other viral diseases, such as dengue, has demonstrated the potential for antibody-based therapies to enhance viral uptake, leading to enhanced viremia and worsening of disease. This phenomenon is referred to as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In the context of influenza, ADE has been used to explain several preclinical and clinical phenomena. Using structural and viral kinetics modeling, we assess the role of ADE in the treatment of influenza with a bNAb.},

  abstract = {Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae is responsible for 1.4 to 4.3 million cases with about 21,000-143,000 deaths per year. Dominance of O1 and O139 serogroups, classical and El tor biotypes, alterations in CTX phages and the pathogenicity Islands are some of the major features of V. cholerae isolates that are responsible for cholera epidemics. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) based analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other infrequent genetic variants provides a robust phylogenetic framework. Recent studies on the global transmission of pandemic V. cholerae O1 strains have shown the existence of eight different phyletic lineages. In these, the classical and El Tor biotype strains were separated as two distinctly evolved lineages. The frequency of SNP accumulation and the temporal and geographical distribution supports the perception that the seventh cholera pandemic (7CP) has spread from the Bay of Bengal region in three independent but overlapping waves. The 2010 Haitian outbreak shared a common ancestor with South-Asian wave-3 strains. In West Africa and East/Southern Africa, cholera epidemics are caused by single expanded lineage, which has been introduced several times since 1970. The Latin American epidemics that occurred in 1991 and 2010 were the result of introductions of two 7CP sublineages. Sublineages representing wave-3 have caused huge outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen. The Ogawa-Inaba serotype switchover in several cholera epidemics are believed to be due to the involvement of certain selection mechanism(s) rather than due to random events. V. cholerae O139 serogroup is phylogenetically related to the 7CP El Tor, and almost all these isolates belonged to the multilocus sequence type-69. Additional phenotypic and genotypic information have been generated to understand the pathogenicity of classical and El Tor vibrios. Presence of integrative conjugative elements (ICE) with antibiotic resistance gene cassettes, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein system and ctxAB promoter based ToxRS expression of cholera toxin separates classical and El Tor biotypes. With the availability of WGS information, several important applications including, molecular typing, antimicrobial resistance, new diagnostics and vaccination strategies could be generated.},

Identifying the genomic regions affected by natural selection within pathogens can aid in the pursuit of effective strategies to control diseases. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide patterns of selection acting on different classes of sequences in a worldwide sample of eight strains of the model plant-pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum graminicola. We found evidence of selective sweeps, balancing selection, and positive selection affecting both protein-coding and noncoding DNA of pathogenicity-related sequences. Genes encoding putative effector proteins and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes show evidence of positive selection acting on the coding sequence, consistent with an Arms Race model of evolution. The 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes coding for effector proteins and genes upregulated during infection show an excess of high-frequency polymorphisms likely the consequence of balancing selection and consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis of evolution acting on these putative regulatory sequences. Based on the findings of this work, we propose that even though adaptive substitutions on coding sequences are important for proteins that interact directly with the host, polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences may confer flexibility of gene expression in the virulence processes of this important plant pathogen.},

  abstract = {As the prevalence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis strains continues to rise, so does the need to develop accurate and rapid molecular tests to complement time-consuming growth-based drug susceptibility testing. Performance of molecular methods relies on the association of specific mutations with phenotypic drug resistance and while considerable progress has been made for resistance detection of first-line antituberculosis drugs, rapid detection of resistance for second-line drugs lags behind. The rrs A1401G allele is considered a strong predictor of cross-resistance between the three second-line injectable drugs, capreomycin (CAP), kanamycin, and amikacin. However, discordance is often observed between the rrs A1401G mutation and CAP resistance, with up to 40\% of rrs A1401G mutants being classified as CAP susceptible. We measured the MICs to CAP in 53 clinical isolates harboring the rrs A1401G mutation and found that the CAP MICs ranged from 8 μg/ml to 40 μg/ml. These results were drastically different from engineered A1401G mutants generated in isogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which exclusively exhibited high-level CAP MICs of 40 μg/ml. These data support the results of prior studies, which suggest that the critical concentration of CAP (10 μg/ml) used to determine resistance by indirect agar proportion may be too high to detect all CAP-resistant strains and suggest that a larger percentage of resistant isolates could be identified by lowering the critical concentration. These data also suggest that differences in resistance levels among clinical isolates are possibly due to second site or compensatory mutations located elsewhere in the genome.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED In infection experiments with genetically distinct Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains, we identified clade-specific virulence patterns in human primary macrophages and in mice infected by the aerosol route, both reflecting relevant model systems. Exclusively human-adapted M. tuberculosis lineages, also termed clade I, comprising "modern" lineages, such as Beijing and Euro-American Haarlem strains, showed a significantly enhanced capability to grow compared to that of clade II strains, which include "ancient" lineages, such as, e.g., East African Indian or M. africanum strains. However, a simple correlation of inflammatory response profiles with strain virulence was not apparent. Overall, our data reveal three different pathogenic profiles: (i) strains of the Beijing lineage are characterized by low uptake, low cytokine induction, and a high replicative potential, (ii) strains of the Haarlem lineage by high uptake, high cytokine induction, and high growth rates, and (iii) EAI strains by low uptake, low cytokine induction, and a low replicative potential. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of host-pathogen interaction and factors that modulate the outcomes of infections. Future studies addressing the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications need to take into account the diversity of both the pathogen and the host. IMPORTANCE Clinical strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are genetically more diverse than previously anticipated. Our analysis of mycobacterial growth characteristics in primary human macrophages and aerogenically infected mice shows that the MTBC genetic differences translate into pathogenic differences in the interaction with the host. Our study reveals for the first time that "TB is not TB," if put in plain terms. We are convinced that it is very unlikely that a single molecular mechanism may explain the observed effects. Our study refutes the hypothesis that there is a simple correlation between cytokine induction as a single functional parameter of host interaction and mycobacterial virulence. Instead, careful consideration of strain- and lineage-specific characteristics must guide our attempts to decipher what determines the pathological potential and thus the outcomes of infection with MTBC, one of the most important human pathogens.},

Computational and genetic loss-of-function analyses corroborate the notion that homeodomain proteins not only provide unique descriptors of neuron type, but also have a critical role in specifying neuronal identity. We speculate that the pervasive use of homeobox genes in defining unique neuronal identities reflects the evolutionary history of neuronal cell-type specification.},

Phylogenetically, this family includes distinct ancient and modern sublineages. The modern strains, contrary to the ancestral counterparts, demonstrated increasing prevalence in many world regions that suggest an enhanced bacterial pathogenicity. We therefore evaluated virulence of modern versus ancient Beijing strains with similar epidemiological and genotype characteristics. For this, we selected six strains that had very similar 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing profiles and belonged to the region of difference 181 (RD181) subgroup but differed using markers (mutT2 and mutT4 genes and NTF locus) that discriminate between modern and ancient Beijing sublineages. The strains were isolated from native patients in Brazil and Mozambique, countries with a low prevalence of Beijing strains. The virulence levels of these strains were determined in models of pulmonary infection in mice and in vitro macrophage infection and compared with that of a strain from Russia, part of the epidemic and hypervirulent Beijing clone B0/W148, and of the laboratory strain H37Rv. The results showed that two of the three modern Beijing strains were highly pathogenic, exhibiting levels of virulence comparable with that of the epidemic Russian strain. In contrast, all isolates of the ancient sublineage displayed intermediate or low virulence. The data obtained demonstrate that the strains of the modern Beijing sublineage are more likely to exhibit highly virulent phenotypes than ancient strains and suggest that genetic alterations characteristic of the modern Beijing sublineage favor selection of highly virulent bacteria.},

  abstract = {The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants.(1) In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology-"pathogenic," "likely pathogenic," "uncertain significance," "likely benign," and "benign"-to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.},

Its impact on serotypes implicated in adult non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia is not known. Beginning in 2008, a 5-year prospective cohort study of adults admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was conducted. Pneumococcal serotype was established using a validated multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The overall incidence for hospitalised CAP and pneumococcal CAP was 79.9 (95\% CI 76.6–83.3) and 23.4 (95\% CI 21.6–25.3) per 100 000 population, respectively. A decline in CAP (incidence rate ratio (IRR) per year 0.96, 95\% CI 0.94–0.99; p=0.016) and pneumococcal CAP (IRR per year 0.84, 95\% CI 0.80–0.89; p{$<$}0.001) was observed over the 5-year period of the study. Between the pre- and post-PCV13 periods of the study, the incidence of CAP due to serotypes included in the PCV7 declined by 88\% (IRR 0.12, 95\% CI 0.08–0.20; p{$<$}0.001), and CAP due to the additional 6 serotypes in PCV13 declined by 30\% (IRR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.51–0.96; p=0.024). Incidence of adult pneumococcal pneumonia declined over the last 5 years, with serotypes included in PCV13 declining post-PCV13 introduction, indicating early herd protection effects from PCV13 infant vaccination on adult non-bacteraemic disease. These effects may accrue over the coming years with implications for national pneumococcal vaccination policies in adults.

  abstract = {Here, we present APPRIS (http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es), a database that houses annotations of human splice isoforms. APPRIS has been designed to provide value to manual annotations of the human genome by adding reliable protein structural and functional data and information from cross-species conservation. The visual representation of the annotations provided by APPRIS for each gene allows annotators and researchers alike to easily identify functional changes brought about by splicing events. In addition to collecting, integrating and analyzing reliable predictions of the effect of splicing events, APPRIS also selects a single reference sequence for each gene, here termed the principal isoform, based on the annotations of structure, function and conservation for each transcript. APPRIS identifies a principal isoform for 85\% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE 7 release for ENSEMBL. Analysis of the APPRIS data shows that at least 70\% of the alternative (non-principal) variants would lose important functional or structural information relative to the principal isoform.},

  abstract = {Bioinformatics pipelines are an integral component of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Processing raw sequence data to detect genomic alterations has significant impact on disease management and patient care. Because of the lack of published guidance, there is currently a high degree of variability in how members of the global molecular genetics and pathology community establish and validate bio-informatics pipelines. Improperly developed, validated, and/or monitored pipelines may generate inaccurate results that may have negative consequences for patient care. To address this unmet need, the Association of Molecular Pathology, with organizational representation from the College of American Pathologists and the American Medical Informatics Association, has developed a set of 17 best practice consensus recommendations for the validation of clinical NGS bioinformatics pipelines. Recommendations include practical guidance for laboratories regarding NGS bioinformatics pipeline design, development, and operation, with additional emphasis on the role of a properly trained and qualified molecular professional to achieve optimal NGS testing quality.

The objective is valid frequency inference for ultimate users who in general have access only to complete-data software and possess limited knowledge of specific reasons and models for nonresponse. For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results. Then, criticisms of multiple imputation are considered, and, finally, comparisons are made to alternative strategies.},

Both species occur in encapsulated and unencapsulated forms, but in S.~mitis the role of the capsule in host interactions is mostly unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine how capsule expression in S.~mitis can modulate interactions with the host with relevance for colonization. The S.~mitis type strain, as well as two mutants of the type strain, an isogenic capsule deletion mutant, and a capsule switch mutant expressing the serotype 4 capsule of S.~pneumoniae TIGR4, were used. Wild-type and capsule deletion strains of S.~pneumoniae TIGR4 were included for comparison. We found that capsule production in S.~mitis reduced adhesion to oral and lung epithelial cells. Further, exposure of oral epithelial cells to encapsulated S.~mitis resulted in higher interleukin-6 and CXCL-8 transcription levels relative to the unencapsulated mutant. Capsule expression in S.~mitis increased the sensitivity to human neutrophil peptide 1-3 but reduced the sensitivity to human β-defensin-3 and cathelicidin. This was in contrast with S.~pneumoniae in which capsule expression has been generally associated with increased sensitivity to human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Collectively, these findings indicate that capsule expression in S.~mitis is important in modulating interactions with epithelial cells, and is associated with increased or reduced susceptibility to AMPs depending on the nature of the AMP.},

  abstract = {NK4, a fragment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), exerts bifunctional action as a competitive antagonist against HGF and its receptor c-Met and an angiogenesis inhibitor. Here we studied the anti-angiogenic mechanism of NK4. In cultured human endothelial cells, NK4 inhibited DNA synthesis induced not only by HGF but also by either basic fibroblast growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor. Even if c-Met expression was diminished by small interference RNA, NK4 inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, indicating that anti-angiogenic action of NK4 is c-Met-independent. Affinity purification with NK4-immobilized beads revealed that NK4 binds to perlecan. Consistent with this, NK4 colocalized with perlecan in endothelial cells. Perlecan is a multidomain heparan sulfate proteoglycan that interacts with basement membrane components such as fibronectin. NK4 inhibited extracellular assembly of fibronectin, by which fibronectin-dependent endothelial cell spreading was inhibited by NK4. Knockdown of perlecan expression by small interference RNA significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of NK4 on fibronectin assembly and cell spreading. In NK4-treated endothelial cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and Rac activation were reduced, whereas overexpression of activated Rac recovered the DNA synthesis in NK4-treated endothelial cells. These results indicate that the association between NK4 and perlecan impairs fibronectin assembly, thereby inhibiting anchorage-dependent signaling. The identified mechanism for angiostatic action provides further proof of significance for NK4 in the treatment of cancer and potentially for vascular regulation as well.},

  abstract = {Estimating transmission chains for dengue Dengue virus (DENV) causes a large number of asymptomatic infections, so surveillance captures only a fraction of cases. Salje et al. developed a method for identifying the number of transmission chains of DENV from sequence data and serology. They found that sequential transmission of DENV typically occurs between households in the same neighborhood. Within high-density urban localities, such as Bangkok, there are surprisingly few transmission chains. This results in epidemic spikes within a regional background of endemicity. Large urban settings may thus act as a source of diverse viruses that can be transported elsewhere. Science, this issue p. 1302 A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual transmission events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic transmission. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60\% of dengue cases living {$<$}200 meters apart come from the same transmission chain, as opposed to 3\% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances {$<$}200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent transmission and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of transmission. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance. Regions of high human population density drive highly localized transmission chains of dengue virus, which then can disperse regionally.

  abstract = {The average spatial distance between transmission-linked cases is a fundamental property of infectious disease dispersal. However, the distance between a case and their infector is rarely measurable. Contact-tracing investigations are resource intensive or even impossible, particularly when only a subset of cases are detected. Here, we developed an approach that uses onset dates, the generation time distribution and location information to estimate the mean transmission distance. We tested our method using outbreak simulations. We then applied it to the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak in Cumbria, UK, and compared our results to contact-tracing activities. In simulations with a true mean distance of 106m, the average mean distance estimated was 109m when cases were fully observed (95\% range of 71–142). Estimates remained consistent with the true mean distance when only five percent of cases were observed, (average estimate of 128m, 95\% range 87–165). Estimates were robust to spatial heterogeneity in the underlying population. We estimated that both the mean and the standard deviation of the transmission distance during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak was 8.9km (95\% CI: 8.4km–9.7km). Contact-tracing activities found similar values of 6.3km (5.2km–7.4km) and 11.2km (9.5km–12.8km), respectively. We were also able to capture the drop in mean transmission distance over the course of the outbreak. Our approach is applicable across diseases, robust to under-reporting and can inform interventions and surveillance.},

Phylogeographic approaches are currently unable to disentangle the relative effects of these competing factors. We develop a spatiotemporally structured phylogenetic framework that reconstructs transmission across spatial scales and apply it to geocoded dengue virus sequences from Thailand (N=726 over 18 years). We find infected individuals spend 96\% of their daytime hours in their home community compared to 76\% for the susceptible population (mainly children) and 42\% for adults. Dynamic pockets of local immunity make transmission more likely in places with high heterotypic immunity and less likely where high homotypic immunity exists. Age-dependent mixing of individuals and vector distributions are not important in determining transmission. This approach provides previously unknown insights into one of the most complex disease systems known and will be applicable across pathogens.},

  abstract = {For most pathogens, transmission is driven by interactions between the behaviours of infectious individuals, the behaviours of the wider population, the local environment, and immunity. Phylogeographic approaches are currently unable to disentangle the relative effects of these competing factors. We develop a spatiotemporally structured phylogenetic framework that reconstructs transmission across spatial scales and apply it to geocoded dengue virus sequences from Thailand (N=726 over 18 years). We find infected individuals spend 96\% of their daytime hours in their home community compared to 76\% for the susceptible population (mainly children) and 42\% for adults. Dynamic pockets of local immunity make transmission more likely in places with high heterotypic immunity and less likely where high homotypic immunity exists. Age-dependent mixing of individuals and vector distributions are not important in determining transmission. This approach provides previously unknown insights into one of the most complex disease systems known and will be applicable across pathogens.},

Treatment was initiated under a diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris and associated PsA. However, eruption extended to the entire body and became pustular, and fever developed. Since PsA symptoms were simultaneously aggravated, and body movements become difficult, he was admitted. A diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch) and associated symmetrical polyarthritis was made. Local therapy was performed. As systemic treatment, oral administration of an corticosteroid and weekly low-dose pulse methotrexate therapy were performed. The skin symptoms and PsA symptoms rapidly improved. At present, about one year after the initiation of treatment, the eruption almost completely disappeared, and joint pain does not present any problem in daily life.},

  abstract = {Nigeria has an emerging problem with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Whole-genome sequencing was used to understand the epidemiology of tuberculosis and genetics of multi-drug resistance among patients from two tertiary referral centers in Southwest Nige-ria. In line with previous molecular epidemiology studies, most isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from this dataset belonged to the Cameroon clade within the Euro-American lineage. Phylogenetic analysis showed this clade was undergoing clonal expansion in this region, and suggests that it was involved in community transmission of sensitive and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Five patients enrolled for retreatment were infected with pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) due to fluoroquinolone resistance in isolates from the Cameroon clade. In all five cases resistance was conferred through a mutation in the gyrA gene. In some patients, genomic changes occurred in bacterial isolates during the course of treatment that potentially led to decreased drug susceptibility. We conclude that inter-patient transmission of resistant isolates, principally from the Cameroon clade, contributes to the spread of MDR-TB in this setting, underscoring the urgent need to curb the spread of multi-drug resistance in this region.},

Genotyping assay oligos corresponding to specific SNP sequences are each linked to a unique sequence (address) that can hybridize to its complementary strand on universal arrays. The arrays are made of beads located in microwells of optical fiber bundles (Sentrix Array Matrix) or silicon slides (Sentrix BeadChip). The optical fiber bundles are further organized into a matrix that matches a 96-well microtiter plate. The arrays on the silicon slides are multi-channel pipette compatible for loading multiple samples onto a single silicon slide. These formats allow many samples to be processed in parallel. This genotyping system enables investigators to generate approximately 300,000 genotypes per day with minimal equipment requirements and greater than 1.6 million genotypes per day in a robotics-assisted process. With a streamlined and comprehensive assay, this system brings a new level of flexibility, throughput, and affordability to genetic research.},

  abstract = {Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a frontline anti-tuberculosis drug that plays a crucial role in the treatment of both drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). PZA is a prodrug that is converted to its active form, pyrazinoic acid (POA), by a nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase encoded by the pncA gene, the mutation of which is the major cause of PZA resistance. Although RpsA (ribosomal protein S1, involved in trans-translation) has recently been shown to be a target of POA/PZA, whole-genome sequencing has identified mutations in the panD gene encoding aspartate decarboxylase in PZA-resistant strains lacking pncA and rpsA mutations. To gain more insight into a possible new target of PZA, we isolated 30 POA-resistant mutants lacking mutations in pncA and rpsA from M. tuberculosis in vitro, and whole-genome sequencing of 3 mutants identified various mutations in the panD gene. Additionally, sequencing analysis revealed that the remaining 27 POA-resistant mutants all harbored panD mutations affecting the C-terminus of the PanD protein, with PanD M117I being the most frequent mutation (24/30, 80\%). Conditional overexpression of panD from M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis or E. coli, or of M. tuberculosis mutant PanD M117I, all conferred resistance to POA and PZA in M. tuberculosis. β-alanine and pantothenate, which are downstream products of PanD, were found to antagonize the antituberculosis activity of POA. In addition, the activity of the M. tuberculosis PanD enzyme was inhibited by POA at therapeutically relevant concentrations in a concentration-dependent manner but was not inhibited by the prodrug PZA or the control compound nicotinamide. These findings suggest that PanD represents a new target of PZA/POA. These results have implications for a better understanding of this peculiar persister drug and for the design of new drugs targeting M. tuberculosis persisters for improved treatment.},

They find an enrichment of DNMs in highly evolutionarily conserved elements that are active in the fetal brain. The authors previously estimated that 42\% of patients with severe developmental disorders carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences. They now estimate that 1\%–3\% of the remaining patients carry pathogenic DNMs in fetal brain-active regulatory elements.},

  abstract = {Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.},

  abstract = {Expression of a capsular polysaccharide is considered a hallmark of most invasive species of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, in which the capsule is among the principal virulence factors and is the basis for successful vaccines. Consequently, it was previously assumed that capsule production distinguishes S. pneumoniae from closely related commensals of the mitis group streptococci. Based on antigenic and genetic analyses of 187 mitis group streptococci, including 90 recognized serotypes of S. pneumoniae, we demonstrated capsule production by the Wzy/Wzx pathway in 74\% of 66 S. mitis strains and in virtually all tested strains of S. oralis (subspecies oralis, dentisani, and tigurinus) and S. infantis. Additional analyses of genomes of S. cristatus, S. parasanguinis, S. australis, S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus revealed complete capsular biosynthesis (cps) loci in all strains tested. Truncated cps loci were detected in three strains of S. pseudopneumoniae, in 26\% of S. mitis strains, and in a single S. oralis strain. The level of sequence identities of cps locus genes confirmed that the structural polymorphism of capsular polysaccharides in S. pneumoniae evolved by import of cps fragments from commensal Streptococcus species, resulting in a mosaic of genes of different origins. The demonstrated antigenic identity of at least eight of the numerous capsular polysaccharide structures expressed by commensal streptococci with recognized serotypes of S. pneumoniae raises concerns about potential misidentifications in addition to important questions concerning the consequences for vaccination and host-parasite relationships both for the commensals and for the pathogen. IMPORTANCE Expression of a capsular polysaccharide is among the principal virulence factors of Streptococcus pneumoniae and is the basis for successful vaccines against infections caused by this important pathogen. Contrasting with previous assumptions, this study showed that expression of capsular polysaccharides by the same genetic mechanisms is a general property of closely related species of streptococci that form a significant part of our commensal microbiota. The demonstrated antigenic identity of many capsular polysaccharides expressed by commensal streptococci and S. pneumoniae raises important questions concerning the consequences for vaccination and host-parasite relationships both for the commensals and the pathogen.},

We studied whether delay in diagnosis (time between onset of symptoms and establishment of diagnosis) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PSA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) changed from year 2000 to 2011. Methods: Month and year of initial symptoms and diagnosis, gender, hospital, year of birth and date of first data entry were obtained for 13 721 patients with RA, PSA or AS who had been registered in the DANBIO registry. Time between symptom onset and diagnosis was modelled using generalised linear regression to predict the average duration for each calendar year of initial symptoms with adjustments for gender, year of birth and date of DANBIO entry. Results: Patients with valid data (RA: 10 416 (73\%); PSA: 1970 (68\%); AS: 1335 (65\%)) did not differ significantly from the whole DANBIO population, except more missing data in early years. The regression model showed that the mean duration from initial symptoms to diagnosis for RA, PSA and AS declined steadily from 30, 53 and 66 months (year 2000), respectively, to 3-4 months (year 2011). Sensitivity analyses including patients who were included after 2005, patients who had received biological treatment or had symptom onset less than 2 and 5 years prior to first entry into DANBIO showed similar results. Conclusion: Since the year 2000, a significant reduction in diagnostic delay was observed in this large cohort of patients with RA, PSA or AS, probably reflecting a stronger awareness of the importance of early diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Background In April 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in the infant immunisation schedule in England and Wales. Despite limited serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) during the first four post-PCV13 years, non-vaccine type (NVT) IPD increased substantially in 2014/15. We undertook a carriage study in 2015/16 to help understand the reasons for this increase. Methods and findings Families with a child aged {$<$}5 years attending a participating general practice in Gloucestershire or Hertfordshire were invited to provide nasopharyngeal swabs from all consenting members. Swabs from 650 individuals (293 under five, 73 five to twenty and 284 {$>$}twenty years) were cultured and serotyped for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Results were compared with those from three previous household studies conducted in the same populations between 2001 to 2013, and with the serotypes causing IPD to estimate case-carrier ratios (CCRs). Overall carriage prevalence did not differ between the four carriage studies with reductions in vaccine-type carriage offset by increases in NVT carriage. While no individual NVT serotype showed an increase in CCR from 2012/13, the composition of the serotypes comprising the NVT group differed such that the overall CCR of the NVT group had significantly increased since 2012/13. Carriage of two PCV13 serotypes, 3 and 19A, was found in 2015/16 (3/650 = 0.5\% and 2/650 = 0.3\% respectively) with no overall reduction in carriage prevalence of PCV13-7 serotypes since 2012/13, though 6C prevalence, a vaccine-related serotype, had reduced from 1.8\% in 2012/13 to 2/648 (0.3\%) in 2015/16, p = 0.013. Conclusions There was continuing evolution in carried NVTs six years after PCV13 introduction which, in addition to being vaccine-driven, could also reflect natural secular changes in certain NVTs. This poses challenges in predicting future trends in IPD. Elimination of carriage and disease due to serotypes 3 and 19A may not be achieved by PCV13.},

Both reference-based mapping and de novo assembly are computationally intensive, generating large intermediary data files, and thus require bioinformatics skills that are often lacking in the laboratories producing the data. Moreover, many research and practical applications in microbiology require only a small fraction of the whole genome data. We developed KvarQ, a new tool that directly scans fastq files of bacterial genome sequences for known variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), bypassing the need of mapping all sequencing reads to a reference genome and de novo assembly. Instead, KvarQ loads “testsuites” that define specific SNPs or short regions of interest in a reference genome, and directly synthesizes the relevant results based on the occurrence of these markers in the fastq files. KvarQ has a versatile command line interface and a graphical user interface. KvarQ currently ships with two “testsuites” for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but new “testsuites” for other organisms can easily be created and distributed. In this article, we demonstrate how KvarQ can be used to successfully detect all main drug resistance mutations and phylogenetic markers in 880 bacterial whole genome sequences. The average scanning time per genome sequence was two minutes. The variant calls of a subset of these genomes were validated with a standard bioinformatics pipeline and revealed {$>$}99\% congruency. KvarQ is a user-friendly tool that directly extracts relevant information from fastq files. This enables researchers and laboratory technicians with limited bioinformatics expertise to scan and analyze raw sequencing data in a matter of minutes. KvarQ is open-source, and pre-compiled packages with a graphical user interface are available at                      http://www.swisstph.ch/kvarq                                        .},

  abstract = {A number of flaviviruses are important human pathogens, including yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Infection with or immunization against any of these viruses induces a subset of antibodies that are broadly flavivirus cross-reactive but do not exhibit significant cross-neutralization. Nevertheless, these antibodies can efficiently bind to the major envelope protein (E), which is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies because of its receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. The structural basis for this phenomenon is still unclear. In our studies with TBE virus, we have provided evidence that such cross-reactive antibodies are specific for a cluster of epitopes that are partially occluded in the cage-like assembly of E proteins at the surfaces of infectious virions and involve-but are not restricted to-amino acids of the highly conserved internal fusion peptide loop. Virus disintegration leads to increased accessibility of these epitopes, allowing the cross-reactive antibodies to bind with strongly increased avidity. The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can thus provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

  abstract = {Understanding the population structure and patterns of gene flow within species is of fundamental importance to the study of evolution. In the fields of population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation are commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that these measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow is common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as wind or water currents. As information about levels of asymmetric gene flow among populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the distribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not be overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from genetic data, complex models based on maximum-likelihood or Bayesian approaches generally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new simpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is presented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of genetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort, using any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These directional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to calculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow patterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called divMigrate-online introduced in this study. Using simulated data sets with known gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving complex migration patterns under a range of study designs.},

  abstract = {The development of plasma biomarkers has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated. Many studies have reported lists of candidate proteins rather than validated candidate markers with an assigned performance to a specific clinical objective. Biomarker research necessitates a clear rational framework with requirements on a multitude of levels. On the technological front, the platform needs to be effective to detect low abundant plasma proteins and be able to measure them in a high throughput manner over a large amount of samples reproducibly. At a conceptual level, the choice of the technological platform and available samples should be part of an overall clinical study design that depends on a joint effort between basic and clinical research. Solutions to these needs are likely to facilitate more feasible studies. Targeted proteomic workflows based on SRM mass spectrometry show the potential of fast verification of biomarker candidates in plasma and thereby closing the gap between discovery and validation in the biomarker development pipeline. Biological samples need to be carefully chosen based on well-established guidelines either for candidate discovery in the form of disease models with optimal fidelity to human disease or for candidate evaluation as well-designed and annotated clinical cohort groups. Most importantly, they should be representative of the target population and directly address the investigated clinical question. A conceptual structure of a biomarker study can be provided in the form of several sequential phases, each having clear objectives and predefined goals. Furthermore, guidelines for reporting the outcome of biomarker studies are critical to adequately assess the quality of the research, interpretation and generalization of the results. By being attentive to and applying these considerations, biomarker research should become more efficient and lead to directly translatable biomarker candidates into clinical evaluation.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the various models that have been used to describe the relationships between gene trees and species trees. Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments. Yet, most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories of genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because genes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events. Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and vice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one direction or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are known. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and species trees. These models account for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting. Some of them consider several types of events together, but none exists currently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene trees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on genomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of sequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better gene trees provide a more reliable basis for studying genome evolution or reconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict that gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will be instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28\%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6\% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the precise pathomechanism of psoriasis is still unknown, various cytokines and growth factors derived from T cells, dendritic cells or keratinocytes, are critically involved in this disease. There have been several studies determining the serum levels of cytokines in patients with psoriasis, but with conflicting results. The levels of various cytokines and growth factors were measured in the sera of patients with psoriasis and compared with those of healthy controls. The correlation with disease severity was also determined. METHODS Sera were collected from 122 patients with psoriasis and 78 healthy controls for ELISA analysis to evaluate the levels of cytokines and growth factors. The severity of psoriasis was determined by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). RESULTS Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased in patients with psoriasis compared with those of healthy controls. The serum levels of IL-2, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and amphiregulin were not significantly different from those of healthy controls. Increased serum levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18 and VEGF correlated with PASI. Furthermore, these cytokine levels were decreased after psoriasis treatment. In contrast, serum levels of IL-10 were decreased in psoriasis and negatively correlated with PASI. DISCUSSION Serum levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18 and VEGF were positively correlated and that of IL-10 was negatively correlated with PASI in Japanese patients with psoriasis. These parameters might be useful for determining the disease activity of psoriasis.},

  abstract = {In the freshwater environment of north India, cholera appears seasonally in form of clusters as well as sporadically, accounting for a significant piece of the puzzle of cholera epidemiology. We describe a number of cholera outbreaks with an average attack rate of 96.5/1000 but an overall low case fatality (0.17). Clinical cholera cases coincided with high rainfall and elevated temperatures, whereas isolation of V. cholerae non-O1 non-O139 from water was dependent on temperature (p {$<$} 0.05) but was independent of rainfall and pH (p {$>$} 0.05). However, isolation from plankton samples correlated with increased temperature and pH (p {$<$} 0.05). A lag period of almost a month was observed between rising temperature and increased isolation of V. cholerae from the environment, which in succession was followed by an appearance of cholera cases in the community a month later. Our results suggested that the aquatic environment can harbor highly divergent V. cholerae strains and serve as a reservoir for multiple V. cholera virulence-associated genes that may be exchanged via mobile genetic elements. In agreement with PFGE, AFLP data also proved that the V. cholerae O1 population was not clonal but was closely related. Our investigation did not support the concept that seasonal cholera outbreaks occur by movement of a single clonal strain across the region, as the clinical isolates from the same years were clearly different, implying that continuous evolution of V. cholerae O1 strains occurs in the cholera endemic area. Interestingly, the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) V. cholerae O1 cells were demonstrated in 2.21\% samples from natural water bodies in addition to 40.69\% samples from cholera-affected areas respectively. This suggests that aquatic environs do harbor the pathogenic O1 strain, though the isolation of culturable V. cholerae O1 is a rare event in the presence of relatively abundant non-O1 non-O139 isolates.},

  abstract = {Echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis of increasing concern. In 1903, the first cases of human polycystic echinococcosis, a disease resembling alveolar echinococcosis, emerged in Argentina. One of the parasites responsible, Echinococcus oligarthrus, had been discovered in its adult strobilar stage before 1850. However, {$>$}100 years passed from the first description of the adult parasite to the recognition that this species is responsible for some cases of human neotropical polycystic echinococcosis and the elucidation of the parasite's life cycle. A second South American species, E. vogeli, was described in 1972. Obtaining recognition of the 2 species and establishing their connection to human disease were complicated because the life cycle of tapeworms is complex and comprises different developmental stages in diverse host species. To date, at least 106 human cases have been reported from 12 South and Central American countries.},

  abstract = {The CHEK2 1100delC protein-truncating mutation has a carrier frequency of approximately 0.7\% in Northern and Western European populations and confers an approximately 2-fold increased risk of breast cancer. It has also been suggested to increase risks of colorectal and prostate cancer, but its involvement with these or other types of cancer has not been confirmed. The incidence of cancer other than breast cancer in 11,116 individuals from 734 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families from the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, and the United States was compared with that predicted by population rates. Relative risks (RR) to carriers and noncarriers were estimated by maximum likelihood, via the expectation-maximization algorithm to allow for unknown genotypes. Sixty-seven families contained at least one tested CHEK2 1100delC mutation carrier. There was evidence of underreporting of cancers in male relatives (422 cancers observed, 860 expected) but not in females (322 observed, 335 expected); hence, we focused on cancer risks in female carriers. The risk of cancers other than breast cancer in female carriers was not significantly elevated, although a modest increase in risk could not be excluded (RR, 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64-2.17). The carrier risk was not significantly raised for any individual cancer site, including colorectal cancer (RR, 1.60; 95\% confidence interval, 0.54-4.71). However, between ages 20 to 50 years, the risks of colorectal and lung cancer were both higher in female carriers than noncarriers (P = 0.041 and 0.0001, respectively). There was no evidence of a higher prostate cancer risk in carriers than noncarriers (P = 0.26), although underreporting of male cancers limited our power to detect such a difference. Our results suggest that the risk of cancer associated with CHEK2 1100delC mutations is restricted to breast cancer, although we cannot rule out a small increase in overall cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Background Most incident cases of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) present among patients with pre-existing psoriasis, and because of the high absolute prevalence of PsA among psoriasis patients this group offers a unique opportunity for risk modification. Several environmental and genetic factors have been associated with PsA. Trauma has been found to be associated with PsA in case series and cross sectional studies. This observation has led to the idea of a “deep Koebner” phenomenon playing a role in PsA, mirroring the Koebner phenomenon in skin psoriasis. We have performed a population based cohort study to determine the risk of PsA following trauma in psoriasis patients. Objectives To evaluate the risk of incident PsA among psoriasis patients exposed to physical trauma. Methods We performed a matched cohort study within the Health Improvement Network (THIN) database among psoriasis patients with data available between 1995 and 2013. Patients exposed to trauma were randomly matched to up to five unexposed controls based on gender, age, and the date of entry into THIN. Trauma exposure was stratified into subgroups of joint, bone, nerve, and skin trauma. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratio of developing psoriatic arthritis among those exposed to physical trauma, and the full model included adjustment for age, gender, date of entry into THIN, duration of psoriasis, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and the number of visits to the general practitioner. Missing values for smoking, alcohol use, and BMI were imputed by a sequential regression method. For comparison an identical analysis was performed in the non-psoriasis THIN population to evaluate the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) following physical trauma. Results Psoriasis patients exposed to trauma (N=15,416) and unexposed controls (N=55,230) were identified and followed for a total of 425,120 person-years (py) during which 1,010 incident PsA cases were recorded. The incidence rate of PsA among unexposed psoriasis patients was 22 (95\% CI 21 to 24) per 10,000 py and 30 (95\% CI 26 to 34) per 10,000 py in the exposed group. The results of the fully adjusted cox model analysis showed that psoriasis patients exposed to trauma had an increased risk of PsA compared to controls, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.32 (95\% CI 1.13 to 1.54). In our subset analysis, bone and joint traumas were associated with multivariate HRs of 1.46 (95\% CI 1.04 to 2.04), and 1.50 (95\% CI 1.19 to 1.90), respectively, while nerve trauma and skin trauma were not associated with a statistically significant difference in risk compared to controls. Patients without psoriasis exposed to trauma did not have an increased multivariate adjusted risk of developing RA: HR 1.04 (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.10) based on an analysis of 551,723 exposed individuals and 2,672,836 unexposed individuals followed for 19,479,771 py. Conclusions We found an increased risk of PsA among psoriasis patients exposed to physical trauma, particularly when trauma to bone and joints was recorded.

  abstract = {Objectives Skin and joint involvement in psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are thought to relate to the so-called Koebner response. Given that dactylitis is non-randomly distributed in the digits, this study tested the hypothesis that the accessory pulleys linked to the flexor tendons were thickened in PsA and thus exhibited koebnerisation. Methods Ninety-six subjects (27 PsA, 27 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 23 PsO and 19 healthy controls (HCs)) were enrolled. The A1, A2 and A4 pulley thickness was measured using a high-resolution probe (22 MHz). All patients were in remission or low disease activity with current dactylitis being excluded. Results Within 864 pulleys investigated, patients with PsA had thicker pulleys in every digit compared with both RA (P{$<$}0.001 and P=0.003) and HCs (P{$<$}0.001). RA and PsO groups had some pulleys in some digits thicker than HCs whereas some others were comparable. The second digit A1 pulley thickness was higher in patients with PsA with previous dactylitis (P=0.020). More pulleys were thickened in the PsA group (165/243, 68\%) than RA (41/243, 17\%; P{$<$}0.001) and HCs (13/171, 7.6\%; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions In established PsA, the accessory pulleys are thickened compared with RA, PsO or HCs and especially in subjects with a history of dactylitis. These findings implicate the involvement of pulleys in PsA-related tenosynovitis and dactylitis supporting the idea of deep koebnerisation in dactylitis and sites of high physical stress.},

  abstract = {Population-level comparisons of prokaryotic genomes must take into account the substantial differences in gene content, resulting from frequent horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and gene loss. However, the automated annotation of prokaryotic genomes is imperfect, and errors due to fragmented assemblies, contamination, diverse gene families and mis-assemblies accumulate over the population, leading to profound consequences when analysing the set of all genes found in a species. Here we introduce Panaroo, a graph based pangenome clustering tool that is able to account for many of the sources of error introduced during the annotation of prokaryotic genome assemblies. We verified our approach through extensive simulations of de novo assemblies using the infinitely many genes model and by analysing a number of publicly available large bacterial genome datasets. Using a highly clonal             Mycobacterium tuberculosis             dataset as a negative control case, we show that failing to account for annotation errors can lead to pangenome estimates that are dominated by error. We additionally demonstrate the utility of the improved graphical output provided by Panaroo by performing a pan-genome wide association study in             Neisseria gonorrhoeae             and by analysing gene gain and loss rates across 51 of the major global pneumococcal sequence clusters.

However, only the selective forces would contribute to adaptation of the bacteria to the physiology and environment of its local host and to its association with gastroduodenal diseases. We studied evolutionary forces acting on variable regions of virulence genes cagA, babA and oipA, which present geographic differences among H. pylori strains from different human groups. Gene sequences in H. pylori strains from Asia, Europe and America were analysed using state of the art analytical methods like the Maximum Likelihood method. The rate and nature of polymorphisms in these virulence genes were also compared among populations using the AMOVA and McDonald-Kreitman tests. We found strong and significant positive selection acting on variable regions of cagA, babA and oipA. We found in cagA from Asian strains regions under positive selection, which localised in amino acid sites defining the Asian fingerprint for this gene and in sites with important biological activity. Different evolutionary forces are acting on the variable region of virulence genes; they partly explain the source of genetic diversity and the differences in risk for gastroduodenal diseases among different human populations.},

This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 25 years and shows how the burden of LRI has changed in people of all ages.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated LRI mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using a modelling platform shared across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study called the Cause of Death Ensemble model. We modelled LRI morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform called DisMod-MR. We estimated aetiologies for LRI using two different counterfactual approaches, the first for viral pathogens, which incorporates the aetiology-specific risk of LRI and the prevalence of the aetiology in LRI episodes, and the second for bacterial pathogens, which uses a vaccine-probe approach. We used the Socio-demographic Index, which is a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to assess trends in LRI-related mortality. The two leading risk factors for LRI disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), childhood undernutrition and air pollution, were used in a decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of changes in LRI DALYs.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In 2015, we estimated that LRIs caused 2·74 million deaths (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·50 million to 2·86 million) and 103·0 million DALYs (95\% UI 96·1 million to 109·1 million). LRIs have a disproportionate effect on children younger than 5 years, responsible for 704 000 deaths (95\% UI 651 000–763 000) and 60.6 million DALYs (95ÙI 56·0–65·6). Between 2005 and 2015, the number of deaths due to LRI decreased by 36·9\% (95\% UI 31·6 to 42·0) in children younger than 5 years, and by 3·2\% (95\% UI −0·4 to 6·9) in all ages. Pneumococcal pneumonia caused 55·4\% of LRI deaths in all ages, totalling 1 517 388 deaths (95\% UI 857 940–2 183 791). Between 2005 and 2015, improvements in air pollution exposure were responsible for a 4·3\% reduction in LRI DALYs and improvements in childhood undernutrition were responsible for an 8·9\% reduction.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}LRIs are the leading infectious cause of death and the fifth-leading cause of death overall; they are the second-leading cause of DALYs. At the global level, the burden of LRIs has decreased dramatically in the last 10 years in children younger than 5 years, although the burden in people older than 70 years has increased in many regions. LRI remains a largely preventable disease and cause of death, and continued efforts to decrease indoor and ambient air pollution, improve childhood nutrition, and scale up the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children and adults will be essential in reducing the global burden of LRI.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background Psoriasis is often accompanied by obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome as risk factors of cardiovascular conditions and premature mortality. Objective The study was aimed at investigating whether psoriatic patients, who carry risk allele of obesity-related FTO gene, are more predisposed to obesity and metabolic disturbances and whether it influences the severity of psoriasis. Methods 197 patients with psoriasis, representing Lower Silesia region of Poland, underwent physical examination and anthropometric measurements. Blood samples for biochemical and genetic analysis were collected. All patients were genotyped for FTO gene rs9939609 variant. Identification of SNP was conducted with the use of minisequencing method. Results Around 63\% of patients were carriers of at least one risk allele A and 20\% were AA homozygotes. The A allele was associated with increased BMI and hip and waist circumferences. The carriers of risk allele had increased PASI and CRP values and tended to have an increased insulin concentration. Conclusion Psoriatic patients, carriers of risk allele of FTO gene rs9939609, have an increased risk for more severe psoriasis and obesity and may develop obesity-induced insulin resistance.},

Yet external benchmarking of this technologies’ capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97\% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94\%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

It is not known whether this elevated rate is caused by a high reinfection rate due, for instance, to living circumstances, or a high rate of progress to disease specific to the patients, or both. In order to address that question we analysed an extensive data set from clinics attended by TB patients in the high-incidence setting near Cape Town, South Africa and found that, in fact, the (average) rate of reinfection (as opposed to the rate of reinfection disease) after cure of a previous TB disease episode is initially about 0.85 per annum. This rate diminishes rapidly over time and after about ten years this rate is similar to the rate of infection in the general population. Also, the rate of progress to disease after reinfection is initially high but declines in subsequent years down to the figure typical for the general population. These findings suggest that the first few months after cure of a TB disease episode form a critical period for controlling reinfection disease in a hyperendemic setting and that monitoring such cured patients could pre-empt a reinfection progressing to active disease.},

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

Estimating the core genome (those genes common to all, or nearly all, strains of a species) is a key component of such analyses. The size and composition of the core genome varies by dataset, but we hypothesised that the variation between different collections of the same bacterial species would be minimal. To investigate this, we analysed the genome sequences of 3,118 pneumococci recovered from healthy individuals in Reykjavik (Iceland), Southampton (United Kingdom), Boston (USA) and Maela (Thailand). The analyses revealed a ‘supercore’ genome (genes shared by all 3,118 pneumococci) of 558 genes, although an additional 354 core genes were shared by pneumococci from Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston. Overall, the size and composition of the core and pan-genomes among pneumococci recovered in Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston were similar. Maela pneumococci were distinctly different in that they had a smaller core genome and larger pan-genome. The pan-genome of Maela pneumococci contained several {$>$}25 Kb sequence regions (flanked by pneumococcal genes) that were homologous to genomic regions found in other bacterial species. Overall, our work revealed that some subsets of the global pneumococcal population are highly heterogeneous, and our hypothesis was rejected. This is an important finding in terms of understanding genetic variation among pneumococci and is also an essential point of consideration before generalising the findings from a single dataset to the wider pneumococcal population.},

Such structure may be due to spatial segregation, but may also reflect any other gene-flow-limiting aspect of a model. In combination with the structured coalescent, this fact can be used to inform phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as to infer parameters such as migration rates and subpopulation sizes from annotated sequence data. However, conducting Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent is impeded by the difficulty of constructing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms (samplers) capable of efficiently exploring the state space., Results: In this article, we present a new MCMC sampler capable of sampling from posterior distributions over structured trees: timed phylogenetic trees in which lineages are associated with the distinct subpopulation in which they lie. The sampler includes a set of MCMC proposal functions that offer significant mixing improvements over a previously published method. Furthermore, its implementation as a BEAST 2 package ensures maximum flexibility with respect to model and prior specification. We demonstrate the usefulness of this new sampler by using it to infer migration rates and effective population sizes of H3N2 influenza between New Zealand, New York and Hong Kong from publicly available hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences under the structured coalescent., Availability and implementation: The sampler has been implemented as a publicly available BEAST 2 package that is distributed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License at http://compevol.github.io/MultiTypeTree., Contact: tgvaughan@gmail.com, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory arthropathy that presents with inflammation of the joints and entheses, including those of the axial skeleton, and is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical phenotype because of the diversity of the associated features, which can include skin and nail disease, dactylitis, uveitis, and osteitis. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis has led to the development of effective biologics and small-molecular drugs targeting specific cytokines and signalling pathways, which can prevent disease progression and improve quality of life. However, at least 40\% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have only a partial response or fail to respond to such treatments. Cytokine inhibitors, mainly those specific for tumour necrosis factor and, more recently, the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway, have been highly successful in the treatment of disease manifestations in several different tissues, although targeting the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway might be more effective in psoriasis than in arthritis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis-which include genetics, environmental factors, and immune-mediated inflammation-are complex, and the relationship between disease of the joint and that of other domains is poorly understood. Improving our understanding of psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis could help to establish validated biomarkers for diagnosis, predict therapeutic response and remission, develop precision medicines, and predict which patients will respond to which therapy. We discuss advances in pathogenetic translational research that could inform these issues.},

Differential diagnosis between an onychomycosis and a psoriatic nail could be challenging; nevertheless, coexistence of onychomycosis and nail psoriasis also occurs and both are common disorders in the general population. Nail psoriasis can be difficult to treat. Treatment of nail psoriasis should consider the body surface area of skin disease, psoriatic arthritis, severity of nail disease, and the impairment in the quality of life. All patients should be tested for onychomycosis before starting a therapy. This recommendation is underlined by the fact that nail psoriasis is mostly treated by immunosuppressive drugs, like steroids, methotrexate, or biologics, which may aggravate mycotic nail infections. Conventional systemic therapy, such as use of steroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and retinoid in the long term, can cause organ toxicities. Currently, use of apremilast and tofacitinib favors an early healing of nail psoriasis because they act directly on the pathogenic targets, distressing the inflammatory signals associated with the initiation and maintenance of the disease activity, and as with several conventional synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, they are characterized by the convenience of oral administration. The number of treatment options has increased considerably in recent years; however, given the heterogeneity of the disease, the therapy should be personalized to individual cases.},

  abstract = {Background: Pneumonia is a leading cause of child morbidity and death. Data on risk factors can guide prevention efforts. Within a study on pneumococcal conjugate vaccine effectiveness, we investigated risk factors for presumed bacterial pneumonia (PBP).  Methods: PBP cases were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uninfected children with lower respiratory tract infection and consolidation on chest radiograph or nonconsolidated infiltrate with C-reactive protein ≥40\,mg/L hospitalized at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH) in Soweto. Age-matched community controls were identified using CHBAH birth records ±1 week of case birth date. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression.  Results: A total of 889 PBP cases (median age 9 months) were matched to 2628 controls. Crowding was a significant risk factor among well-nourished children (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.29, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89–2.78), but not in those with low weight-for-age. Malnutrition was associated with PBP; strength of association was highest in the absence of crowding (aOR: 6.68, 95\% CI: 4.74–9.42). Exclusive breastfeeding was protective only among HIV-unexposed children (aOR: 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.54–0.78). Self-reported maternal HIV infection was a risk factor among children exclusively breastfeed up to 4 months (aOR: 2.33, 95\% CI: 1.53–3.55). Having indoor tap water was protective (aOR: 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.54–0.78), whereas a primary care giver who smoked was a risk factor (aOR: 5.15, 95\% CI: 2.94–9.03).  Conclusions: Our findings confirm several known pneumonia risk factors and highlight complex interactions between factors, including HIV exposure, breastfeeding, malnutrition and crowding. Improved housing, reduced secondhand smoke exposure and HIV prevention among women of reproductive age could lessen the child pneumonia burden.},

This scheme can instruct descriptive and experimental studies that determine the importance of ancestral events (including horizontal gene transfer) in shaping the present-day pathogen. For example, heterologous complementation in an NTM can test the functional importance of M. tuberculosis-specific genetic insertions. An appreciation of both phases of M. tuberculosis evolution is expected to improve our fundamental understanding of its pathogenicity and facilitate the evaluation of novel diagnostics and vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In South Africa, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2009 with a three-dose schedule for infants at 6, 14, and 36 weeks of age; a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in 2011. In 2012, it was estimated that 81\% of 12-month-old children had received three doses of vaccine. We assessed the effect of vaccination on invasive pneumococcal disease. METHODS: We conducted national, active, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease. We calculated the change in the incidence of the disease from a prevaccine (baseline) period (2005 through 2008) to postvaccine years 2011 and 2012, with a focus on high-risk age groups. RESULTS: Surveillance identified 35,192 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. The rates among children younger than 2 years of age declined from 54.8 to 17.0 cases per 100,000 person-years from the baseline period to 2012, including a decline from 32.1 to 3.4 cases per 100,000 person-years in disease caused by PCV7 serotypes (-89\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -92 to -86). Among children not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the estimated incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased by 85\% (95\% CI, -89 to -79), whereas disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes increased by 33\% (95\% CI, 15 to 48). Among adults 25 to 44 years of age, the rate of PCV7-serotype disease declined by 57\% (95\% CI, -63 to -50), from 3.7 to 1.6 cases per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among children in South Africa fell substantially by 2012. Reductions in the rates of disease caused by PCV7 serotypes among both children and adults most likely reflect the direct and indirect effects of vaccination.

  abstract = {Routine full characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is culture based, taking many weeks. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can generate antibiotic susceptibility profiles to inform treatment, augmented with strain information for global surveillance; such data could be transformative if provided at or near the point of care. We demonstrate a low-cost method of DNA extraction directly from patient samples for M. tuberculosis WGS. We initially evaluated the method by using the Illumina MiSeq sequencer (40 smear-positive respiratory samples obtained after routine clinical testing and 27 matched liquid cultures). M. tuberculosis was identified in all 39 samples from which DNA was successfully extracted. Sufficient data for antibiotic susceptibility prediction were obtained from 24 (62\%) samples; all results were concordant with reference laboratory phenotypes. Phylogenetic placement was concordant between direct and cultured samples. With Illumina MiSeq/MiniSeq, the workflow from patient sample to results can be completed in 44/16 h at a reagent cost of £96/£198 per sample. We then employed a nonspecific PCR-based library preparation method for sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer. We applied this to cultured Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG DNA and to combined culture-negative sputum DNA and BCG DNA. For flow cell version R9.4, the estimated turnaround time from patient to identification of BCG, detection of pyrazinamide resistance, and phylogenetic placement was 7.5 h, with full susceptibility results 5 h later. Antibiotic susceptibility predictions were fully concordant. A critical advantage of MinION is the ability to continue sequencing until sufficient coverage is obtained, providing a potential solution to the problem of variable amounts of M. tuberculosis DNA in direct samples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine are now used in most countries. To monitor global and regional progress towards improving child health and to inform national policies for disease prevention and treatment, we prepared global, regional, and national disease burden estimates for these pathogens in children from 2000 to 2015. METHODS: Using WHO and Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation collaboration country-specific estimates of pneumonia and meningitis mortality and pneumonia morbidity from 2000 to 2015, we applied pneumococcal and Hib cause-specific proportions to estimate pathogen-specific deaths and cases. Summary estimates of the proportion of pneumonia deaths and cases attributable to these pathogens were derived from four Hib vaccine and six PCV efficacy and effectiveness study values. The proportion of meningitis deaths due to each pathogen was derived from bacterial meningitis aetiology and adjusted pathogen-specific meningitis case-fatality data. Pneumococcal and Hib meningitis cases were inferred from modelled pathogen-specific meningitis deaths and literature-derived case-fatality estimates. Cases of pneumococcal and Hib syndromes other than pneumonia and meningitis were estimated using the ratio of pathogen-specific non-pneumonia, non-meningitis cases to pathogen-specific meningitis cases from the literature. We accounted for annual HIV infection prevalence, access to care, and vaccine use. FINDINGS: We estimated that there were 294\hphantom{,}000 pneumococcal deaths (uncertainty range [UR] 192\hphantom{,}000-366\hphantom{,}000) and 29\hphantom{,}500 Hib deaths (18\hphantom{,}400-40\hphantom{,}700) in HIV-uninfected children aged 1-59 months in 2015. An additional 23\hphantom{,}300 deaths (15\hphantom{,}300-28\hphantom{,}700) associated with pneumococcus and fewer than 1000 deaths associated Hib were estimated to have occurred in children infected with HIV. We estimate that pneumococcal deaths declined by 51\% (7-74) and Hib deaths by 90\% (78-96) from 2000 to 2015. Most children who died of pneumococcus (81\%) and Hib (76\%) presented with pneumonia. Less conservative assumptions result in pneumococcccal death estimates that could be as high as 515\hphantom{,}000 deaths (302\hphantom{,}000-609\hphantom{,}000) in 2015. Approximately 50\% of all pneumococcal deaths in 2015 occurred in four countries in Africa and Asia: India (68\hphantom{,}700 deaths, UR 44\hphantom{,}600-86\hphantom{,}100), Nigeria (49\hphantom{,}000 deaths, 32\hphantom{,}400-59\hphantom{,}000), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (14\hphantom{,}500 deaths, 9300-18\hphantom{,}700), and Pakistan (14\hphantom{,}400 deaths, 9700-17\hphantom{,}000]). India (15\hphantom{,}600 deaths, 9800-21\hphantom{,}500), Nigeria (3600 deaths, 2200-5100), China (3400 deaths, 2300-4600), and South Sudan (1000 deaths, 600-1400) had the greatest number of Hib deaths in 2015. We estimated 3·7 million episodes (UR 2·7 million-4·3 million) of severe pneumococcus and 340\hphantom{,}000 episodes (196\hphantom{,}000-669\hphantom{,}000) of severe Hib globally in children in 2015. INTERPRETATION: The widespread use of Hib vaccine and the recent introduction of PCV in countries with high child mortality is associated with reductions in Hib and pneumococcal cases and deaths. Uncertainties in the burden of pneumococcal disease are largely driven by the fraction of pneumonia deaths attributable to pneumococcus. Progress towards further reducing the global burden of Hib and pneumococcal disease burden will depend on the efforts of a few large countries in Africa and Asia.

With the reduction in cost of NGS, DNA samples from entire families can be sequenced and linkage analysis can be performed directly using NGS data. Inspired by 'burden' tests, which are used for complex trait rare variant association studies, we developed the collapsed haplotype pattern (CHP) method for linkage analysis. Using data from several deafness genes we demonstrate that the CHP method is substantially more powerful than analyzing individual variants. Unlike applying NGS data filtering approaches, the CHP method provides statistical evidence of a gene's involvement in disease etiology and is also less likely to exclude causal variants in the presence of phenocopies and/or reduced penetrance. The CHP method was implemented in the SEQLinkage software package, which can perform linkage analysis on NGS data or can generate data compatible with many linkage analysis programs, reviving them for use in NGS era.},

Among non-toxigenic V. cholerae, ctxAB negative, tcpA positive (CNTP) isolates have the highest risk of disease. From 2001 to 2012, 71 infectious diarrhea cases were reported in Hangzhou, China, caused by CNTP serogroup O1 isolates. We sequenced 119 V. cholerae genomes isolated from patients, carriers and the environment in Hangzhou between 2001 and 2012, and compared them with 850 publicly available global isolates. We found that CNTP isolates from Hangzhou belonged to two distinctive lineages, named L3b and L9. Both lineages caused disease over a long time period with usually mild or moderate clinical symptoms. Within Hangzhou, the spread route of the L3b lineage was apparently from rural to urban areas, with aquatic food products being the most likely medium. Both lineages had been previously reported as causing local endemic disease in Latin America, but here we show that global spread of them has occurred, with the most likely origin of L3b lineage being in Central Asia. The L3b lineage has spread to China on at least three occasions. Other spread events, including from China to Thailand and to Latin America were also observed. We fill the missing links in the global spread of the two non-toxigenic serogroup O1 V. cholerae lineages that can cause human infection. The results are important for the design of future disease control strategies: surveillance of V. cholerae should not be limited to ctxAB positive strains.},

  abstract = {The treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases is challenging, as drug options are limited, and the existing diagnostics are inadequate. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been used in a clinical setting to investigate six cases of suspected extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) encountered at a London teaching hospital between 2008 and 2014. Sixteen isolates from six suspected XDR-TB cases were sequenced; five cases were analyzed in a clinically relevant time frame, with one case sequenced retrospectively. WGS identified mutations in the M. tuberculosis genes associated with antibiotic resistance that are likely to be responsible for the phenotypic resistance. Thus, an evidence base was developed to inform the clinical decisions made around antibiotic treatment over prolonged periods. All strains in this study belonged to the East Asian (Beijing) lineage, and the strain relatedness was consistent with the expectations from the case histories, confirming one contact transmission event. We demonstrate that WGS data can be produced in a clinically relevant time scale some weeks before drug sensitivity testing (DST) data are available, and they actively help clinical decision-making through the assessment of whether an isolate (i) has a particular resistance mutation where there are absent or contradictory DST results, (ii) has no further resistance markers and therefore is unlikely to be XDR, or (iii) is identical to an isolate of known resistance (i.e., a likely transmission event). A small number of discrepancies between the genotypic predictions and phenotypic DST results are discussed in the wider context of the interpretation and reporting of WGS results.},

OBJECTIVE To identify and characterize pathogenetic players in PPP. METHODS Clinical and anamnestic data as well as skin and blood samples of 60 PPP patients were collected. Healthy participants served as controls. Analysis of patient samples and cultured primary skin cells was performed by ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Upon screening of blood mediators in PPP patients, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) emerged as being significantly upregulated compared to healthy participants. LCN2 blood levels were independent of age, sex, or concomitant psoriasis vulgaris. Keratinocytes in PPP skin lesions were important LCN2 producers. In vitro, LCN2 production of these cells was upregulated by IL-1β and further enhanced by IL-17 and TNF-α, while IL-22 had no effect. Accordingly, a positive relationship between blood IL-1β and LCN2 levels was evident in PPP. LCN2 blood levels also showed a positive correlation with PPP pustule score, Dermatology Quality of Life Index and blood levels of the pro-atherogenic molecule resistin. CONCLUSIONS In PPP, increased blood levels of LCN2 indicate an important activity of IL-1β in the epidermis, may contribute to skin neutrophil infiltration, and may point to an increased pro- atherosclerosis risk.},

  abstract = {Carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults is rarely detected by the gold standard culture method. With molecular tests of high sensitivity now available, we analysed upper respiratory tract samples collected during autumn/winter 2012/2013 from parents of PCV7-vaccinated infants and from childless adults, directly comparing culture and qPCR-based S. pneumoniae detection. As compared to the gold standard of testing nasopharyngeal swabs, qPCR-based analysis of oral samples significantly improved detection of pneumococcal carriage (5\% versus 20\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) with higher carriage rates in parents compared to childless adults (34\% versus 7\%; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Molecular methods also increased the number of serotype-carriage events detected with higher carriage frequencies of serotypes 3 and 7A/F and lower of serotypes 6C/D and 15A/B/C in parents compared to their infant children. We provide evidence that culture-based methods severely underestimate adult carriage rates and for the superiority of testing oral samples over nasopharyngeal swabs. The substantial circulation of pneumococci in parents is however, not representative for the entire adult population. While age-associated differences in serotype carriage suggests reservoirs outside infants as potential sources of vaccine-serotypes contributing to weakening of vaccine herd effects, we find no evidence for reservoirs in adults contributing to serotype replacement in carriage.},

  abstract = {Background There is a perception that genomic differences in the species/lineages of the nine species making the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) may affect the efficacy of distinct control tools in certain geographical areas. We therefore analyzed the prevalence and spatial distribution of MTBC species and lineages among isolates from pulmonary TB cases over an 8-year period, 2007–2014.   Methodology Mycobacterial species isolated by culture from consecutively recruited pulmonary tuberculosis patients presenting at selected district/sub-district health facilities were confirmed as MTBC by IS6110 and rpoß PCR and further assigned lineages and sub lineages by spoligotyping and large sequence polymorphism PCR (RDs 4, 9, 12, 702, 711) assays. Patient characteristics, residency, and risks were obtained with a structured questionnaire. We used SaTScan and ArcMap analyses to identify significantly clustered MTBC lineages within selected districts and spatial display, respectively.   Results Among 2,551 isolates, 2,019 (79.1\%), 516 (20.2\%) and 16 (0.6\%) were identified as M. tuberculosis sensu stricto (MTBss), M. africanum (Maf), 15 M. bovis and 1 M. caprae, respectively. The proportions of MTBss and Maf were fairly constant within the study period. Maf spoligotypes were dominated by Spoligotype International Type (SIT) 331 (25.42\%), SIT 326 (15.25\%) and SIT 181 (14.12\%). We found M. bovis to be significantly higher in Northern Ghana (1.9\% of 212) than Southern Ghana (0.5\% of 2339) (p = 0.020). Using the purely spatial and space-time analysis, seven significant MTBC lineage clusters (p{$<$} 0.05) were identified. Notable among the clusters were Ghana and Cameroon sub-lineages found to be associated with north and south, respectively.   Conclusion This study demonstrated that overall, 79.1\% of TB in Ghana is caused by MTBss and 20\% by M. africanum. Unlike some West African Countries, we did not observe a decline of Maf prevalence in Ghana.},

OBJECTIVE This study investigated whether nail findings can be used to discriminate between PsA and psoriasis without arthritis. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 118 patients with PsA and 974 patients with psoriasis without arthritis who visited St. Luke's International Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between July 2003 and February 2015. Patients with PsA were classified according to the Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis criteria. Skin lesion severity was assessed by using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and 9 types of nail findings were investigated. RESULTS The incidence of nail involvement in patients with PsA was 67.6\%. Female sex, presence of transverse grooves, onycholysis, and splinter hemorrhages were significantly related to PsA, with transverse grooves demonstrating the strongest association (odds ratio, 5.01; 95\% confidence interval, 2.31-10.8; P \textbackslash textless .01). Furthermore, the presence of transverse grooves was strongly related to both distal interphalangeal arthritis and enthesitis. LIMITATIONS The PsA population was relatively small. CONCLUSIONS Nail findings enabled us to distinguish patients with PsA from those without arthritis. The presence of transverse grooves is significantly associated with PsA and may be associated with distal interphalangeal arthritis and enthesitis.},

  abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (MRSA) represents more and more S. aureus infections. MecA, the novel coding gene of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a of MRSA, is the key resistance factor of β-lactam, but little is known about the evolution of this gene. Given the crucial role of mecA in S. aureus physiology and β-lactam resistance, the selective forces may contribute to adaptation of the bacteria to the special environments such as its host or antibiotics. To understand the evolution of this gene, we screened GenBank database and analyzed mecA of 249 S. aureus strains. Twenty-nine unique alleles with 26 unique amino acid sequences were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed three main groups of mecA in the global S. aureus strains. Analysis of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3, and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of the codeML package and a random-effects likelihood (REL) method of HyPhy package for the site-specific ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates suggested that fourteen sites in the allosteric domain of PBP2a have been subjected to strong positive selection pressure. Mutations of two positive selection sites (N146K and E239K) were reported to be essential for ceftaroline- or L-695, 256-resistant. Further study indicated that the positive selection pressure might be more likely related to the host's inflammatory or immune response during S. aureus infection. Our studies provide the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the mecA of S. aureus, contributing to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this bacterium.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The detection of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) is important for understanding genetic heterogeneity using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Various computational algorithms have been proposed to detect variants at the single nucleotide level in mixed samples. Yet, the noise inherent in the biological processes involved in NGS technology necessitates the development of statistically accurate methods to identify true rare variants. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian statistical model and a variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM algorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more computationally efficient on tests of relatively low coverage (27× and 298×) data. Furthermore, we show that our model with a variational EM inference algorithm has higher specificity than many state-of-the-art algorithms. In an analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel variants that have not yet been reported. Our model also detects the emergence of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a pair of concomitant variants. CONCLUSIONS We developed a variational EM algorithm for a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify rare variants in heterogeneous next-generation sequencing data. Our algorithm is able to identify variants in a broad range of read depths and non-reference allele frequencies with high sensitivity and specificity.},

Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95\% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p{$<$}0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.
